1,"We have persistent scammers preying on this community

Folks, a reminder that [Rule 3](/r/offmychest/about/rules) focuses this community's scope on providing emotional support only. We do not allow solicitation or material offers.

This means OPs cannot hint at or ask for money, and community members cannot offer money or food. There are local services that can verify and address a person's situation better than any of us can (and many services will not turn people away if they are asking for it). A kind community member offered a scammer a job and that is okay.

This community is read by millions of people, and scammers around the world know this. We have cultivated an empathic community so we know it can be hard to resist offering material help. It takes only one person to make it worth it because it costs nothing to post. That is why the rules are strictly enforced.

There are many signs of a scammer. They will present a financially desperate situation often with a highly emotional component. They are likely to mention payment services. They may have payment services in their Reddit profile and ask people to look at their profile. They will ask people to privately message them. All of these behaviors may be obfuscated with weird spacing and other ways to evade detection. If they evade detection it's up to the community to report it. Do not call out OPs, report only.

Thank you for your cooperation.",10,46,0.21739130434782608

3,"Icked bc he called my bush disgusting

I (25f) been dating this guy for a few months now and it’s overall been going well. I have fun with him and we’re maybe not a perfect match but I’ve had nothing but positive things to say. Until a couple week ago he said something that’s been bothering me and I can’t seem to let it go. We were getting more intimate and he made a comment about wanting me to fully shave down there and said my full bush is “disgusting.” I kinda shook it off in the moment but that really bothers me. I can understand having a preference but calling a natural part of a woman’s body, MY BODY, disgusting??? This man is almost 10 years older than me, at his big age it strikes me as incredibly immature and rude to say something like that. It feels petty but I think I’m going to dump him over this. Kinda bummed bc I had hope for this one but I just can’t imagine my future husband ever saying something like that to me.

Edit: I just wanna thank everyone real quick for their support and advice, I really appreciate it! I saw some people address this so I made a comment to this effect but I wanted to add it here bc I think the context is important. He was pretty upset when I said I wouldn’t shave and has continued trying to convince me to shave, which is really off putting. I am a very small person and I get mistaken for a high schooler often. I know I can pass for as young as 14, and this means I have to be really careful about the type of men I tend to atrract. I’ve had men fetishize me over this before so when a man makes a comment like this it raises some red flags for me. A preference is one thing, but yall may be surprised how often grown ass men try to push their little girl fetish on me so I can never be too careful. I’m not accusing this guy in particular of anything, just saying there’s a reason why it bothers me so much.",16,283,0.05653710247349823
4,"Im ruining a mans life

I just turned 17 and a 40 year old man tried grooming me. Emphasis on tried because I told my parents when he asked me out. As you can imagine, my parents were furious at him. He doesn't even know that anyone knows yet, he doesn't know that in just a few days he's going to be called into a meeting which is going to ruin his job and reputation completely. And I feel awful about it. I know he deserves punishment but maybe it's going too far. Ontop of that, my parents are considering filing a police report against him. I know he's a horrible person who maybe even deserves this, but i can't help but feel guilty. Like maybe I was leading him on, on accident?

I think the worst part about this is the fact that he has no idea. He doesn't know I told my parents or anyone for that matter. Part of me wishes i had kept it to myself, but at the same time i know it would've been selfish to do so since he would've probably gone after other girls and i don't want anyone to deal with that.",25,158,0.15822784810126583
5,"My husband is asleep...

My husband usually wakes up at 5-6 am because he works (from home) early. However, he's been sick the past couple days, so it's 10 am here and he's still asleep.

So I have to keep it all to myself for the time being that I JUST TOOK A PREGNANCY TEST AND IT'S POSITIVE!!!!!!

We're both in our late 30s and have only been trying to conceive for a couple months -- we both expected it would take much longer due to our age and some medical stuff I have, so I was not expecting this so soon.

We've agreed that if I ever got pregnant we wouldn't tell anyone until the second trimester, so it'll still be a secret between us two for a little bit. But for now, until he wakes up, it's just me who knows.

It's a beautiful day here, with the smell of lilacs coming in the window and the birds singing. And I feel like I'm a part of it all...the circle of life. I never thought I wanted this so bad until this morning. I've had so many doubts and fears but now I feel at peace.

I'm so happy.

PS I left the positive test on the bathroom sink for him to find when he wakes up :)

EDIT: He woke up and went to get some water, but didn't go to the bathroom right away... so I lasted about 24 seconds before I said ""Honey, I wanna show you something, go into the bathroom and look at the sink...""

He looked confused, went in and saw the test, and was thrilled!!! He immediately lit up and was like ""This is so great! Wow!"" Since he's sick, we're social distancing, so we did an air hug... I then hugged the fridge and gave it a big smooch, like it was my surrogate husband lol. It's kinda silly we can't touch right at this moment, but even more important for me to stay healthy now that I AM PREGNANT! We then hung out for an hour and he purchased us some pregnancy books online, I made us oatmeal, and we shared our joy and excitement with one another before the poor sick fella headed back to bed. We talked about how in the future, when we're sick, we won't get to stay in bed and rest all day, we'll still be taking care of a kid. WOW!

Bonus - I did tell my best friend, who is a doctor and has been walking me through the fertility journey and all. Surprise -- she's pregnant too! She didn't want to tell me yet because she worried it would upset me since she knows I'm trying. Now we'll have babies the same age, assuming all goes well. What joy!

Thank you all for the positive responses, I never expected anyone to care -- what good hearts people have. Thank you for sharing in our joy!",3,40,0.075

7,"Childhood friend killed gf. My take upset people back home.

Trigger warning, this post contains suicide, depression, dv and murder. I’m changing names and omitting details for privacy, even though some info is public or easy to find.

Adding some backstory to give context. 

Luke and Steph were kids from my neighborhood. We weren’t close, but they were often at my house due to proximity and my stepbrother, who was Luke’s close friend since early childhood.

Luke and Stephanie dated from their early teens into adulthood. By high school, I heard things through my stepbrother—concerns about Luke being abusive, that Steph was dealing with depression, and that her parents didn’t like Luke. My stepbrother even covered for her being with Luke, lying to her parents.

Years later, Luke threw a university graduation party. Luke and my sb got in an explosive argument that ended their friendship. My stepbrother refused to talk about it and still won’t. I’ve encouraged him to reconcile over the years, assuming it was some falling-out over girls or life choices. Now, I wonder if there was more serious to it. I have no idea, though.

Fast forward to this last weekend: Luke killed Stephanie.

Depending on what news article you read it’s skewed slightly different. 

These are the statements from different news articles, not all statements overlapped between news sources, however all the sources I’m using are local papers that I trust enough and 1 national common news sources:

1. He says it was a suicide pact and he couldn’t kill himself  
2. Steph has failed suicide attempt(s) in the past 
3. Steph has struggled with depression 
4. There is a history of abuse 
5. He shot her 3 times in the head while asleep
6. He lied to the police and said she shot herself  
7. He allegedly tampered with her body after
8. There was a message from Steph’s discord to someone she was going to commit suicide 

I have a group chat with some family/home town friends. Someone shared an article about it. Everyone’s tone was very sympathetic for Luke, how he’s a good kid. It did rub me the wrong way. A few messages were sent back and forth in the chat feeling bad for Luke, when I decided to send this

“I don’t know exactly what happened. It’s possible Luke is telling the truth about a suicide pact, and he just couldn’t follow through. Steph had depression, I understand how overwhelming that can be. But the history of abuse, the fact she was shot multiple times while asleep, and that he tampered with the body and initially lied to police — those are details make me feel uncomfortable. Being in a long-term relationship from such a young age can complicate things, especially when abuse is involved. I’m not saying that automatically makes someone responsible, but it can contribute to a harmful dynamic. I’m not claiming to know the full story — I just think it’s reasonable to want a thorough investigation. I've seen too many true crime stories where the killer initially claims innocence or that their spouse wanted to die. I don't think it is fair what people are saying about Luke online, I agree it is toxic. I just want whatever happened to be investigated, and for there to be real accountability.”

Now I’m getting backlash. People in the chat saying I’m making him out to be the bad guy or implying that I’m “starting conspiracies.” I didn’t think I was being extreme, just cautious about assuming innocence or guilt.

I’m confused why people seem to be taking his statement at face value, in the chat. I don’t want to pass blame. Just be open that many things could have happened. 

I messaged back saying I didn’t think I was being that extreme but now the chat has just moved on to new topics. I feel frustrated. 

Was that out of line? Did I overstep? Should I not have not said that to everyone, if so I’m struggling to identify where I went wrong?",5,126,0.03968253968253968
8,"My best friend cheated on her boyfriend, spiralled and now it’s affecting our whole friend group

Okay so I (F25), K (M25), and P (F25) have been best friends since we were 17 — first year of college. We’ve been through everything together. Dumb choices, heartbreaks, moving cities — you name it. We’ve always had that chaotic but unbreakable trio energy.

Fast forward to now, P had been dating A (M24) for the last 2 years. They were serious, like talking marriage serious. But recently, P started reconnecting/flirting with her old situationship — let’s call him POS (because honestly… he is). A saw the messages, confronted her and broke up with her.

Instead of taking time to reflect or even try to fix things, P went full spiral. Like, downloaded Bumble within 24 hours, started lining up dates, going out constantly — but here’s the kicker — she’s still lowkey wanting A back. She won’t admit it, but it’s obvious in the way she talks about him.

And here’s where my secondhand anger really kicks in — me and P had a mutual friend who genuinely liked her. He was sweet, thoughtful, kind of the golden retriever type. P would only talk to him when she was bored or needed attention and he eventually caught feelings for her. Then one day, out of nowhere, she ghosted him completely. No explanation, nothing. I stayed friends with J, and I’ve seen firsthand how hurt he was by that.

So now watching her do something similar — mess with someone’s emotions and jump to the next thing while still being emotionally stuck on the last — it’s really frustrating. Like, girl… this is a pattern. And it’s starting to affect how I see her, and our friendship too.

What’s making my head spin even more is that despite me and K both begging her to block POS, she’s still talking to him. Still entertaining him. This guy literally came out of nowhere, ruined her two-year relationship, and she’s acting like he’s some prize she needs to win. It’s insane.

Not only that, but she’s been begging for his attention like a child. And the worst part? POS has a long history of emotionally traumatizing P — they’ve been on-and-off for years. It’s like watching someone run straight into traffic after you’ve screamed at them to stop.

There’s a lot more but I needed to get this out first. Might update if people are interested.",3,34,0.08823529411764706
9,"I feel like I've ruined my husband's life

My husband was a relatively ""popular"" person when we met, he has a great sense of humour. We met at work. I was the weird quiet shy girl and he was the funny, confident guy. We have been together for nearly 13 years.

He grew up around friends, he wasn't allowed access to the Internet. I grew up on my own with just my games consoles, my parents rarely came home. I enjoyed school, but skipped classes because I wasn't good at socialising. I never really had any social interaction growing up, aside from on call of duty or halo. 

My husband met me and he says I brought out the ""true him"", I introduced him into gaming and anime and we got on great. However, his friends and family seem to have vanished over the years since we met. His family don't really like me, they think im the reason he doesnt see them and spme have said they dont like me because I am weird. I encourage him to but he says he doesn't feel like he can be himself around them.

I just feel so guilty. He used to have so many friends and he's got a nice big family too. But none of them want to see him because of me. Both my parents are dead, so I only have him and our son. I just feel like theyd be better off without me.",5,14,0.35714285714285715
10,"I think I used sex to get a letter of recommendation for medical school..

 I (22 F) feel like I might have used sex to get a letter of recommendation for medical school. Sorry if this is long but I havent told anyone and would just like to get it out. I dont feel like I was manipulated in any way, I just feel like it needs to get off my chest.

I didnt do amazing on the MCAT and believe I just barely meet the minimum requirements to get into the medical school I want to go to. However, I work at a place that is affiliated with the school and literally right next to it. My boss, who I dont really work with is a medical doctor and a letter from him would be actually huge for my application. 

   I dont really have much rapport with him since I dont necessarily work with him at all, but he does know I want to go to medical school and our relationship is mostly of the ""Good morning!"" variety. 

   Our work does have a book club that some of the doctors attend, I have never been to one. I asked him in his office one day if he would be attending the next one, and he said yes since he is hosting it lol. I didnt realize that. I told him there was something I wanted to talk to him about and asked if after the book club would be fine, he said sure. Hes super professional at work and is mostly short, but polite with people. Kind of intimidating really.

   I mentioned to some of my coworkers that I would be asking him for a letter and they all thought it was a good idea and a letter from him would be great. So after the meeting, I nervously laid out my pitch, and he said that even though he doesnt really work with me, he will talk with my coworkers who do and would happily write a letter. I thanked him and we started talking about the rest of my application and he told me his experience with medical school and what might help in preparation, bla bla bla. I just felt like I was presenting myself as super nervous and not confident, and asked to use the restroom. I kind just freshened myself up and intended to just present myself better lol. 

   When I came back out, I just sat more closer to him on the couch and tried to keep the conversation going a bit, asked him about himself more and he was super nice, but not weird in any way. I knew from work that there are renovations planned and I asked him about that and he was telling me its been super stressful behind the scenes and he really hopes hes able to secure the funding. Then I asked how does a busy man like him blow off steam, and told him Ive been super stressed lately too. And we both kind of laughed aaaaaaand I could feel the awkward tension just rise momentarily lol and I have NO IDEA what came over me, but I put my hand on his lap and said one of the dumbest things I have ever said in my life lol. 

  And then it happened. 

  
  He hasnt mentioned it in any kind of way, and work just carried on like normally, but he did give me an absolutely glowing letter of recommendation and I just feel like he felt obligated to? I guess he already agreed before I did the deed, but yea, I just cant shake that it was a really bad move on my part and was completely out of character for me. Hard to believe I know, But yes.. thanks for letting me get this off my chest reddit LMAO.",2,51,0.0392156862745098
11,"Why do girls keep showcasing this to me?

I go on a date with a girl, it’s goes well and in the flow of conversation they become compelled to tell or show me that they attract ‘elite’ men. What I define is elite will be made clear in my examples. This keeps happening on first dates and it’s starting to chip away at my confidence as I usually get ghosted after date 2 or 3. 

So these are my last three first dates, two were 
from dating apps but they all went very well. 

1. Shows me a picture of a model she went on a couple dates a while back. She Talks some shit about him and how she wouldn’t date him. Shows me the chat log where he’s clearly still texting her like a booty call.

2. Mentions she went on a few dates with a rich racing car driver who on the first date, admits to being freshly divorced and proposes her to be one of his girlfriends - one for every city. She ridicules him yet is mentioning weekends in his penthouse and being away together in luxurious locations etc.

1. It’s a double date with her best and her fiancé. We are in a swanky influencer restaurant. My date and her friend point out some girls on dates who they suspect are gold diggers. They then go on about how easy and obtainable that gold digger lifestyle is for them but they choose not to pursue it. As if it were a selfless sacrifice they were doing for us and I should feel Guilty. 

If there is only one certainty in these examples it’s that they weren’t saying it to try make me jealous or repel me. They just felt compelled to say it.

Look I can understand in girl world that saying something like 
“Ugh, this footballer just wants to sleep with me”
To your friends could be a brag. Is what it is.
But to a guy like me it just reads as ‘you aren’t reaching my standards’ which is more than fair but it’s almost humiliating having to hear these stories, especially with such smugness or clear unresolved feelings. I honesty rather the person just reject me. 


I have to be careful as these type of experiences can easily make you seek comfort and understanding from YouTubers and podcasters who maybe toxic or resentful.",8,42,0.19047619047619047

my parents were born and raised in india. I'm not. I was born in the uk. i've lived here my whole life. no one from india (cousins, aunts, etc) considers me to be indian. they think i'm 'foreign'.

no one from this country thinks im english, either. i attend a school with many people of colour, all immigrants too obviously, and thought maybe i'd grow to appreciate my culture, but I get snide comments about how I 'don't count as brown' because im paler.

idk where to get information on the topic and educate myself bc my parents were raised with the indian history curriculum, obviously they're taught that kashmir is an indian territory.

I know I'm lucky to live such a privileged lifestyle with parents that make a (not to jinx it) great amount of money and a nice school and nice friends but I can't help how I feel.

Trigger warning for physical trauma. 

Yesterday morning my wife and I were upstairs and heard a car crash outside and a woman start to scream. We ran outside and saw an SUV parked and a motorcycle in the middle of the street. 

My wife grabbed her phone and called 911 while I ran to the woman that was hysterical, asking if she was okay and if the baby she had in the car was okay. She was unable to stop screaming and answer. (The baby was absolutely fine by the way, not even a bump)

I ran around to the drivers’ side and the man that was on the motorcycle was under her front tire and had likely been hit and then driven over. I was a medic in the Air Force so I was hoping to perform some kind of first aid but this man was facedown and shaking violently, and as I watched he stopped moving altogether.

15,"My partner cheated on me

It was our 2 year anniversary yesterday and my gift was my partner admitting they cheated on me a month ago. The kicker? We’ve been in an open relationship almost the entire relationship. We closed it recently to focus on strengthening our relationship in couple’s therapy cuz we’ve been having communication issues. They chose to cheat, to not use protection, and to not tell me about it for a MONTH. We don’t use condoms together, I have an IUD. 

My boundary when we were open was just to always use protection, get tested regularly if sleeping around, and to be honest with me. But they didn’t do any of that. They agreed to close it, we’ve been having unprotected sex together, and they literally broke every boundary I have. Now they’re getting tested today. 

I don’t even care that they fucked someone else even though they agreed to close the relationship. I care that they’ve put my health at risk. It wasn’t just like an unprotected blowjob from a stranger, it was unprotected ANAL and I’m just so angry. Like idc if you’re choosing to make risky decisions for yourself, don’t throw my health in the middle of that?? They chose to not tell me or even get tested for a MONTH. We could have gotten on on preventative antivirals, I could have made an informed decision not to have unprotected sex with them.

I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone in my life about this cuz I don’t want everyone in my life to hate them. I feel like people will judge me if I don’t leave. I’m judging me. Like do I have any self respect?

Literally RIGHT before this happened we were in a really good place. For the first time, I truly felt sure that this could be the one, we could go the distance together. They were being so good to me. We talked about marriage and finances and the future and I felt so hopeful that this could become something real. But a week later things got a little stressful again, and THIS is what they did. Because it felt too real? Because they wanted to self-sabotage? 

I know logically it’s not my fault. I know it has nothing to do with me but there’s that part of me asking why I’m not enough. What I did wrong, what I could do better. I know it’s on them and not me. But it hurts so fucking much and I just don’t know what to do with this information. I don’t want to leave. I’m scared of the results of the tests. We run a business together, we’re in a band together, we’re building a life together, and I love them. I just don’t know how I’m ever gonna trust them or feel safe again. How does anyone move past something like this? I wanna just shove it down and make it go away. I’m flipping between incredibly dissociated, so sad that I’m sobbing, and so angry that I could smash a window if I didn’t calm myself.

16,"Sister had me do stuff to her when we were kids:

Feel the need to talk about this publicly for some form of self acceptance or something idk. Feel like it may help me in some way as it definitely comes with shame and insecurity but I digress.

From the ages 4-6 (rough estimate) my (now 24M) older sister who’s 6 years older than me had me do a large amount of sexual things to her on multiple occasions. 

I honestly don’t know when it stopped but I think she recognized it was wrong at some point and it ended. 

Eventually I got to a point I’d say around 10 or 11 when I recognized what sex was and what had actually happened. Forcing myself to think that it was a dream or nightmare, but eventually constantly breaking down to myself knowing that it was real. 

Kept that secret for awhile and never said it to anyone until highschool, when I was about 17 where I told my first girlfriend, cause it eventually started affecting me negatively sexually. 

It brought me so much shame and disgust with myself, I had a severe mental breakdown where I had to tell my parents. 

They were understanding at first but, then had my sister randomly pop up at our house like an intervention one day to talk about it. She said “She didn’t remember it but was sorry if it happened.” And that’s it, was never brought up again.

Almost as if my family had never even had that conversation 

Still affects me to this day. 

Started seeing someone recently and I sometimes find myself becoming insecure or deflecting mentally. She’s not doing anything at all, literally anything super supportive and understanding, and a literally breath of fresh air haha.

Don’t want to fuck that up and thought pubically saying this would help me accept it and that it’s just been a part of my life and who I am. 

Have been more vocal about it to close friends which is helpful but, shit can be scary and feel awful talking about it.

Anyway thanks for reading, hope you feel less alone if you relate. 

alright goodnight <3, up at 1:30

Edit:
Thank you for all the support, feels nice knowing it’s not just me having to go through this. 

Also I did go to therapy for a little, and it helped but somehow this has helped a lot more with the acceptance of it and it being a part of me. Stopped going because I couldn’t afford it at one point but, think I’m in a position to go back and work it out more.

I (21 F) have had this thing with a guy (20 M) for a month and a half now. I just got out of a 4 year long term relationship and this is the first guy I have had serious feelings for since. I really opened up to him and just a week or two ago I slept with him. My best friend (21 F) knows all this and I told her that I was falling in love with him. Yesterday night we went to a bar with a bunch of friends and it was huge and I got separated from group for an hour. When I finally found everyone again I saw he had his arm around her and I got upset. However, I didn’t know that wasn’t all that happened. The next morning I am in the bathroom and I hear two girls from friend group talking about me and the “situation” not knowing I am in the stall next to them. One of the girls goes “I had to distract her all night so she wouldn’t notice”. I said  “lol” letter for letter out loud and I heard them run out. I talked to my best friend after and found out they made out in front of my whole friend group I said nothing got up and walked away and haven’t said anything to her since. I had to pry the information out of her because she was acting like they only flirted.

19,"I finally deleted the number of the person I’ve loved in secret for eight years, and I’m re-learning who I am without them

I met A (I’ll keep it vague) when we were both 19. We bonded over dumb memes and midnight gaming sessions, and I convinced myself that one day she’d feel the same way I did.
Spoiler: she didn’t.

Instead, we drifted into that weird, comfortable limbo where she’d vent about the guys she dated while I listened, offering “advice” that was really just thinly-veiled hope. I dated other people too, but every relationship felt like a layover on the way back to her.

Two months ago she got engaged. I was invited to the wedding. I smiled, congratulated her, and then spent the entire drive home gripping the steering wheel so hard my hands cramped. I realized I’d let eight years of maybes keep me from living my own life.

Tonight—after staring at my phone for way too long—I opened our message thread, scrolled all the way to the top, reread the inside jokes, the late-night “you up?” snaps, the random TikToks… and then I hit delete contact.
No dramatic announcement. No “we can’t be friends anymore.” Just me, my phone, and a lot of adrenaline-laced sadness.

And here’s the crazy part: five minutes later, the sadness leveled out into something like relief. For the first time since my teens, my future isn’t subconsciously routed through someone else’s orbit. I can pick hobbies without wondering if she’d think they’re cool, plan trips without hoping she’ll tag along, flirt with someone new without feeling like I’m cheating on a fantasy.

I’m posting this mostly to hold myself accountable. Tomorrow I’ll probably wake up and instinctively look for her name in my notifications. I’ll miss sending her memes she’ll “totally love.” I’ll miss her birthday in October. But I won’t miss the quiet self-betrayal that came with every ignored feeling.

If you’re reading this and you’ve got your own almost-but-not-quite person rattling around in your head, consider this a gentle nudge: you deserve a life that doesn’t hinge on what someone else might one day feel.

21,"I just want him all the time and I don’t get it

We’ve 34&39 been together for almost 3 years now. I’ve had 2 other guys and an ex husband before him and it’s never been like this. 
My first relationship/marriage I thought I was maybe asexual. Sex was meh for me and I didn’t like being touched much or kissing. I was with a great guy after and realized that wasn’t the case. I actually did enjoy those things and it was eye opening for me. That ended after a year and I dated somone briefly but nothing serious.

Then I met my boyfriend. He made me realize not only do I like physical touch but it’s actually my love language. To go from one end of the spectrum to the other was wild to me. I like to touch him all the time. Walking past, gotta touch his bum or his shoulder or his back. Standing around? Gonna put my arms around him from behind. He does the same and I can’t imagine not having that now. 
When it comes to sex he gets me off at least once everytime and really pays attention to my needs every time.
I want it at least every other day and have never really initiated until this relationship and now it’s so regular. I have found if I don’t have some kind of sexual contact with him at least every other day it effects my mood which seems so dumb. Because I don’t want to bug for sex too much I got in the habit of giving bjs all the time especially on my period when I’m out of commission. I’m the one asking him for them. Last 2 nights in a row and the weirdest part to me is I get excited to give them now. Last night he was being flirty cause I wore a dress so he kept checking out my bum so by the time we get to bed I take off my panties with my dress on in front of him to tease and I crawled in bed and touched him a little. He comes back to bed after getting ready and we kiss goodnight but he slipped tongue so we make out and I ask “does this mean I get to suck your dick tonight” and he says yes and I genuinely got excited. By the time I’m done it makes ME happy and satisfied now. Like 2 nights just attending to him and I get so turned on during when I hear him enjoy it but I’m satisfied AND I sleep better.

I was thinking about it this morning and it’s so weird. I feel satisfied from just that now. He just turns me on so much and makes me so happy I get satisfied just from pleasing him now.
I don’t think he gets it but I am position I think about sex and his body more than he does.

I never enjoyed it with my ex husband and it was just an obligation throw in from time to time. I can’t wrap my head around how different everything is.
I wish I could properly express to him just how much I want him and am attracted to him but I don’t think he gets it or believes me.

22,"Saw a dream that made me feel normal after a long time

For context, I'm 22m. I am closeted gay from India. I recently saw a dream where I was in a classroom with all my friends. And for some reason, there were names of different students on the board. And beside each student's name was written their sexuality. 
What I saw was that beside my name, the word ""Gay"" was written. And a person was announcing the name of each person along with their sexuality. The class was noisy, students were talking to each other, throwing paper bits at each other. 

As the time for my name to get announced was getting closer, I felt this sudden rush of fear and anxiety in me. It felt so real I cannot explain. I started panicking as my name and sexuality were going to be announced to everyone. In my mind, I was thinking of excuses to give to my friends. Some sort of excuse for the fact that the word ""gay"" was written besides my name. 

And then the moment struck. My name was announced and so was my sexuality to everyone. I felt as if my life was over. I don't remember exactly but I think I even contemplated unaliving myself at that point. 

But to my suprise, nobody gave a damn. Everyone went about their activities. They were still talking, throwing paper bits at each other. It's not that they didn't hear it. They heard it. But they couldn't care less. As if it was acceptable. 

This made me feel so relaxed and relieved. I felt no anxiety or pain or fear. It felt so normal.

I’m a straight woman ..physically, mentally, emotionally and I know I’m emotionally inclined toward men, and I’ve always envisioned myself with one. But at this point in life, I just can’t see men as lovable or worth sharing a life with.

From childhood to now, most of the men in my life excluding my father have disappointed me in every possible way including Brothers, friends, colleagues, seniors, strangers… almost every man I’ve known has lacked emotional depth, empathy, basic human decency, understanding, self-awareness, and any real sense of responsibility towards others in general and towards themselves. It’s exhausting.!

I hate to admit it, but I’ve reached a point where I genuinely feel resentment. It’s like I always have to fight just to be treated like a human when I’m around men. I never feel safe, never feel human. I’m done.

What hurts more is that I constantly see men choosing life partners based on just two things: how she looks, and how convenient she makes his life. That’s it. Emotions, effort, true connection? Rare to nonexistent.

Meanwhile, the women I’ve known—friends, mentors, family, colleagues, stranger even acquaintances have been the complete opposite: emotionally intelligent, empathetic, kind, supportive, lovable. Honestly, they have all the qualities I’d want in a life partner.

I’ve made it a long way but sometimes I see the road ahead and I just don’t even want to deal with it.

31,"I feel disrespected over something I once gave my full consent to. (F27 and My Bf M26)


LONG POST AHEAD.


Hi. I don’t even know how to start this.

I’ve been carrying something so heavy in my chest for weeks now, and I finally reached a point where I just need to let it out. I have no one to talk to about this—no friends, no family, no one in my real life knows this part of my story. I’ve kept this completely hidden, mostly because I know how people would react. It’s the kind of story that would earn judgment, shame, maybe even disgust.

But I’m not here to glamorize anything. I’m not here to pretend I didn’t make mistakes. I just… need to be heard. I need to say this out loud, even if it’s just to strangers on the internet.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for four years. We live together. We’ve built a life, a home, a rhythm. Like most couples, we’ve had our share of ups and downs—fights, reconciliations, intimacy, laughter. But somewhere in the middle of all that, something changed. Not just in our relationship—but in me.

I used to be so insecure. So jealous. I hated it every time I’d catch him looking at other women, or stalking random girls online. Even something as small as a sexy post from a dancer or a model would trigger a full-blown emotional reaction. I’d cry, we’d argue, I’d spiral into feelings of not being enough. I would go through his phone, his history, social media. Every little thing that felt like a betrayal broke me. My self-esteem took hit after hit, and every argument felt like a confirmation of what I feared most—that I wasn’t enough for him.

But then, something shifted. Maybe it was because I got tired of constantly hurting. Maybe I subconsciously detached. One day, I just… stopped reacting. I didn’t cry. I didn’t feel jealous. Instead, I started pointing out pretty girls to him when we were out. I’d say things like, “She’s cute, right?” It started feeling less threatening. I honestly thought I was healing—evolving into someone more secure, more mature.

And somewhere along the way, a fantasy started to form.

I can’t even tell you exactly when or how it began. It was so subtle at first. But eventually, the idea of him being with another woman no longer hurt me. It turned me on. We started talking about it together—what ifs, hypotheticals, and slowly, it became part of our shared sex life. It felt like something secret, intimate, almost powerful. It was just ours. A world only we understood.

We talked about everything. We set boundaries. We made rules. It was clear that it wasn’t supposed to be about emotions—it was just about the thrill. The openness. The trust. We started small. We made a dummy account and dipped our toes into the world of chatting with girls. Sometimes it was him messaging; sometimes it was me. Sometimes we’d even pay for virtual experiences, like VCS. We kept it digital, safe, controlled. And again, it felt like it was ours. Something we were building and enjoying together.

Then we came across this one girl on Facebook. Her profile was like a walking invitation—very suggestive posts, revealing photos, captions that left nothing to the imagination. She wasn’t subtle about what she wanted. She seemed like the kind of person who was open to casual fun, no strings attached. So we pushed the fantasy further.

We started messaging her. She didn’t know we were a couple. Most of the conversation came from my boyfriend’s end, but I’d chime in sometimes too. She flirted back. She was wild, direct, no-filter. It felt like we were leveling up this fantasy—but something about it already started feeling… different.

Then slowly, her true colors began to show. She started dropping hints about money. At first, it was small—mentioning how her load ran out during a call, or how she was hungry and didn’t have money for food. It wasn’t direct, but it was obvious. Eventually, it escalated. She’d say things like, “If you really want me, why not show it?” or “I can’t waste my time if there’s no benefit.” She made it sound like she was doing us a favor, like she was the prize. And yet, somehow, my boyfriend kept entertaining her.

That was the first time I felt replaced in our own fantasy.

Eventually, they made plans to meet in person.

That’s when my heart started to ache.

Before he left to meet her, I asked him one thing:
“Can we make love first?”

It wasn’t even about sex. I needed to feel grounded, secure—like I still mattered the most. I needed that emotional intimacy to remind me that I wasn’t being replaced. That I was still his person. That this was still ours.

But instead, he said something I will never forget.

“I want to save it for her.”

I laughed a little, trying to mask how much that stung. I asked again. I was basically begging in a soft voice. I said, “Please, let’s just do it first.” And he replied,

“She might wonder if I don’t finish much.”

That broke something deep inside me. I felt humiliated. Worthless. Disposable. Like I was no longer part of this shared world we created—like I had handed him the keys to something sacred, and now I was being locked out of my own fantasy.

Suddenly, it wasn’t ours anymore. It was his.
His desire. His choices. His control.
And I was just the girl who said “yes” to everything.

I told him how hurt I was. I told him, “If you go through with this, don’t expect me to be here when you come back.” I turned away, heartbroken, trying to fall asleep through the lump in my throat.

But later that night, he woke me up. He was getting dressed.
He was still going.
Even after I cried. Even after I said how much it broke me.
He still left.

And when I reminded him again, “Don’t expect to come back to me,”
All he said was,

“I just don’t want to lose the place I sleep in.”

That was it.

Not “I don’t want to lose you.”
Not “I’m sorry you’re hurting.”
Just concern about not having a place to sleep.

That’s when I realized that maybe, deep down, this was never about “us.” Maybe I was just a convenience. Someone who gave him permission to fulfill his desires, so he wouldn’t feel guilty about them. Someone who convinced herself this was “intimacy” when it was really emotional abandonment in disguise.

And the girl? She probably never even liked him. She just saw an opportunity to milk some money, and he was too caught up in his thrill to notice. Or maybe he noticed—and didn’t care.

And yes—I agreed to this. I even suggested some of it.
But I never imagined it would feel like this.
Like I gave someone permission to hurt me.

And I guess that’s why I’m here, Reddit.
Not to be bashed. Not to be pitied.
Just to ask… was I foolish for thinking this was about trust?

Was I ever truly part of this? Or was I just the audience applauding while he got everything he wanted?

I know I made mistakes. I know I ignored red flags.
But it’s hard to forgive myself for betraying myself.

37,"I missed my meet cute a year ago- I still can't get over it

This might not mean much to a lot of you but I just need to share these feelings that's unexpectedly been inside me for a while now. 

Hello, I (23m) met a guy exactly a year ago and that moment taught me the meaning of ""love at first sight"". 

I was selling secondhand books on the local market. I had garnered some attention from readers but it was overall pretty slow going. Until he showed up. A guy around my age approached and looked through my display. I immediately couldn't take my eyes of him but I didn't know why. During this time we made small bits of conversation, mostly little compliments. (I like your hair, awesome piercings etc.) I don't remember what I replied, from how flustered I was by him. 

Among the books I was selling were the Heartstopper books, his interest (and conversation bc of it) revealed he was also into men and that did something to me. I had never understood what people meant by ""butterflies in your stomach"" but it happened then. It was at this point that I also registered my best friend beside me looking at me strangely, for he had never seen me react like this before. 

Lastly the boy picked up a book I had read and annotated. I apologised for 'ruining' the book and offered it for free to him. He replied saying: ""Well I can't refuse that now can I, I'll take the heartstopper books and this one as well, your thoughts written down in it only make it more perfect."" He then left briefly to get some money from his bag. 

This is where I missed my chance. Everything inside my brain was yelling at me to write down my phone number, instagram or ANYTHING AT ALL so I could get to know him. But his parting words had left me frozen in place, unable to do anything. 

Instead I sold the books to him in a sort of out of body experience, I barely remember doing it. But I do remember him. The words he said and the way he said them. The way he smiled at me. The kind look in his eyes, like he couldn't look away from me either. 

And throughout the past year I have kept thinking of him. How he's doing. If he liked the books. If I planned an activity to do, I'd wonder that if I had left my number-- would I have invited him as well? 

It might sound creepy and I don't mean it that way. I'm ofcourse leaving out some information for privacy reasons but I got a few bits of info on him and he genuinly seems like someone I'd love to be friends with, and maybe let that slowly grow into something more if that makes sense chemistry wise. 

Today it has been one year and eventhough I have met him for about 15 minutes, my life's changed. I look at people differently. See the beauty in items like he saw it in my annotated books. I see a different reality in which I had been brave enough to leave him my number.

So now I have graduated and earn a pretty decent salary already. Great right? Well now comes my issue. I stood by this job mainly for the money, but its the biggest emotional drain I have ever felt. My boss is more toxic than the waste which floats in our oceans and I really want a change to my educational field. However I fucked up. I didn´t build a portfolio during school, I a have a few embarrassing half done projects. I didn't do internships as they were all unpaid. I feel like I have nothing to show for myself but a diploma, which obviously is not enough in this economy. And I live in a country where its expensive as shit just to pay rent, so simply quitting and getting a part time job is not something me and my partner can afford. We would have to move and our home means everything to me. 

So I am just here, submitting my job applications and tracking my rejections. I don´t blame them for not wanting me as I am not exceptional. Others are. I have valuable experience leading, making business decisions and similar, but what does that give me as a developer? Nothing I guess.

41,"Just bought home my child who is the product of rape and I’m just struggling with it all

I (17f) just brought my baby home today and it’s very bitter sweet. Firstly I want to say I love my baby girl very much it’s more the context of her conception and birth and my own situation that is making it all bitter sweet. Also this is gonna be a really long vent so i apologise in advance.

Pretty much I just don’t feel ready to be a mother. I’m 17 and a complete mess I can’t lie. I’ve been in and out of foster care and bounced around from family members for years and ended up with my drug addict day who pimped me out to his friends (which resulted in me getting pregnant).

At this point I freaked out and ran away after finding out I was pregnant as I knew I couldn’t stay but didn’t know where to go so I ran (not smart in hind sight I know but I was 16 and terrified).

I ended up living on the streets for a month (I had been homeless before so I had places to sleep that were safe ish) but ended up breaking down at a doctors appointment (for an ongoing medical issue) when they wanted to do full bloods and told this poor lady everything.

At this point social services got involved (and actually did something for once) and found me a place to live and I ended up a place for young vulnerable mothers to help me look after my baby. At this point I also decided to keep the baby as although the circumstances weren’t great it didn’t feel right to abort for me. 

During the pregnant I had a lot of complications as I was underweight, I’m type 1 diabetic and have uncontrolled epilepsy which eventually lead to my baby being born at 27 weeks after I had a life threatening series of seizure brought on by pneumonia. 

After the birth we were both very unwell and I met her for the first time when she was two weeks old. Since then she’s had a lot of issues (heart defects, under developed lungs, etc) and was born extremely underweight and has been in the hospital for about 4.5 months but finally was brought home today which was great and I’m so happy to have my baby girl with me.

But I feel immense guilt as I feel like her health issues are my fault and that I have caused her to suffer and I can’t escape the guilt I did something wrong although the doctors have told me it wasn’t my fault and I did everything right. Also even thought my baby is home due to my seizures I can’t do basic things like bath her by myself or pick her up and I feel like I’m not a proper mother. I also can’t breast feed her as I’m on medications that could hurt her which makes me sad as it a key bonding experience. Also there’s a court case coming up to convict her father of rape and my father of child abuse ect and I’m scared to testify as I don’t want to associate my beautiful daughter with those people I don’t want to see her as the product of rape yk.

So genuinely just a lot going on and I’m still struggling with my physics and mental health and I just want to do a good job of being a parent. My parents fucked me from birth (I’ve got foetal alcohol syndrome from my mother) and I don’t want my kid to end up the same way or in care (not that I’m being threatened with her being taken away but still).

44,"I was turned down for a job opportunity in my field - the guy they hired is my lazy coworker

I am a horticulture major; unfortunately there are a lot of very rocky jobs in my field. I currently work at a medical cannabis facility and it is an unstable job. Seven months in, over 14 employees have quit or gotten terminated. There are some environmental factors that make the workplace too harsh for the pay.

Three months ago, we hired a new guy named Bob. He had a background in forestry work, landscaping and worked a maintence job at a local Horticultural facility. The first 90 days of being brought on is a probationary period and it is essential to be on time.

Bob was consistantly late during this period and when he was working, he would frequently half-ass everything and would sit on buckets and browse his phone. He could definitely keep up with labor at times, but he would get winded easily and would take frequent breaks to go stretch or sit down for a while.

During his 90 days, he was called out for his tardiness and phone usage. He started to work harder but would take multiple bathroom breaks and would take an extra half hour on his lunch. 

Whilst working this job, I have been job hunting and looking for a better opportunity. It is hard to find a good position and decent wage in this field. I am also looking for positions outside of horticulture.

I ended up applying to an organic lawn care company. The interview was very thorough. I'd say it went very well and the manager and I talked on a personal level. They invited me to complete a form to do a background check, DMV record check and checked on my references. It seemed like I was a strong candidate and it was likely I'd be brought on.

Three weeks later, they politely turned me down and said they were ""very impressed"" with me and this was a tough decision. They could only bring on a single new hire and they went with another candidate. I didn't take it personal, said thank you and I continued to search for a new job.

Things stayed the same at my current job. Bob eventually put in his resignation. I asked him about his new job and we discovered we both applied for the same company and they chose Bob over me. He was totally shocked as I have been training him for months. It was a bit of a jab to my ego, but more than anything it is really a surprise. They hired the worst guy on our team of four.

Today is the last day of Bob's two weeks and he chose not to show up or notify anyone. Nobody is that surprised, and even the managers are joking that his new boss made a mistake and that he won't last at his new job. Nobody knows the full story. 

I simply wanted to let my story be heard. I am resisting the urge of sending a snippet of this story to the recruiter and manager of the lawn care place, but that may be extremely petty and look bad on my part. I think nature will take its course and they will realize they hired a lazy guy.",2,23,0.08695652173913043

46,"Frustrated because everyone thinks she’s grooming me

I (18f) have been friends with a professor (f40) for a couple months now. Honestly, we got off on a strange foot because I asked her to be my mentor like 9 months ago bc she is in the profession id like to go into but she said no and then I never really saw her again until we suddenly started running into each other all the time like 3 months later.

I’m a lesbian with mommy issues so I developed a crush but to be clear I know nothing will happen. She does NOT have feelings for me, however, everyone around me calls her a pedo because of her behavior. I just think she doesn’t have proper boundaries but I’m wondering if I’m being blind just because I like her. 

Some things my friends have been alarmed over:

When we really first started running into each other I pointed out how often we see each other and she replied “ikr, maybe it’s a sign”

I gave her a gift for Christmas and she proceeded to ask if she could have my number, if I was free to go out to coffee and if I’d want to potentially come shadow her across the country if she got approved for a project. Then she ghosted me a week after when I tried to confirm coffee plans.

We had a conversation where I came out to her and she proceeded to “wish she was a lesbian”, speak about how she’d like to marry a woman and then ask for my help with a project and offer to pay me. I refused payment and she offered dinner instead. Asked if I was of drinking age even though I’ve told her before I’m not, and then said “aw man, I was gonna buy you wine with dinner”

We have conversations about sex constantly. Nothing crazy, mostly outlandish inside jokes abt animal sex or about books with sex in them. I told her I write erotica and she asked to read it ( I said no)

We follow each other on socials and she left a comment under one of my posts in which I was lip syncing to a song, she said she would add that song to her sex writing playlist.

Massaged my hands cause I was stressed out.

Okay. This isn’t even all of it and I’m aware all of this sounds fucking crazy but she’s just like this. With a lot of people! Her friends especially.

When ppl cant overpower you with words they start physically showing their power,but thats a weak man thing to do (ig probably)..



Like eventually, everything falls apart… so bad, you don’t even know why. There are days when you feel like everyone hates you — just because there are others getting more attention than you. Or you think you are way more perfect to have their attention. YES GUYS, Being too perfect is a curse.

Like, you understand everyone way too perfectly, and they assume they can say anything, do anything — you’ll just adjust yourself or understand them, as usual. You’re the one observing the chaos caused by others, watching the outcome and the result, but never the one who's causing trouble for some reason. You are the observer, not the one who suffers.

So you assume you’re being overdramatic — like the one who *should* be hurt is the one who suffers, not you. You never lie, never get into relationship stuff, get good grades, appreciation from others — meanwhile, inside you, because of all the chaos, the emotion growing is hate, anger toward everyone.

You start believing life is not good. You start taking everything lightly. You start feeling numb. And people’s feelings — emotions — start seems dramatic to you.

You begin thinking everybody is being dramatic. Or that big tasks which seem impossible to others feel easy to you. You start becoming ungrateful. You become the one who never asks for or takes favors from anyone. You start looking for ways to earn, to overcome all this shit.

48,"The lead singer of a band made me feel so comfortable but sometimes I feel like it wasn't a big deal

Throwaway because reasons.

I've been sitting on my feelings about this encounter with this band for years because I don't know if I'm justified in feeling creeped out or if I'm overthinking. I won't name the band but I'll give the hint that their name sounds like a Blood on the Dancefloor tribute band. 

Before Covid, I went to quite a few small time metal shows in my area. My husband (then boyfriend) was in a band and they were always striving to network with other bands and play with them. One day, they were contacted by an event coordinator asking if they wanted to play at a venue with a headlining band they'd never heard of. They agreed because a show's a show and the venue happened to be one of their favorites at the time and where they got their start.

There was drama before they even had a chance to play together. Husband's band was contacted by multiple people in the metal scene who had worked/preformed with the band. I won't go into details, but it involves money. Apparently, the band was blacklisted in one state all together. No other bands in the area will play with them and no venue will host them. Husband's band contacted them about it, and after some conversation, they still decided to do the show. Turns out they were contacted in the first place because other bands who were supposed to play dropped out due to the drama.

I was my husband's band's only roadie, so I went with them to nearly every show. We arrived early for the set up and for the bands to get acquainted. The first thing that struck me about the headlining band's singer was the obnoxious front man attitude he had. He was loud, fake friendly, wore a creepily wide fake smile and laughed at everything with a fake yes man sort of laugh. He also looked more like he was in an emo/pop punk band than a metal band, but that could have been because of the genre of metal he played. They didn't sound metal at all.

The singer tried to talk to everyone, but shifted his focus on me for a while. Asked who I was here to see, so I told him ""I'm with my boyfriend. He's in one of the bands playing tonight."" I put extra emphasis on ""my boyfriend,"" which didn't seem to deter him.

At one point, he introduced me to a small group of girls who had been following him around all night. He said, ""these are our biggest fans! They follow us to every show up and down the east coast. You should get to know them. I think you'd get along with them really well!"" He then left me with these wide eyed, plastic smiled girls who looked like they had been brainwashed into some cult. They stared at me smiling and I just stared back thinking, what the fuck was he on about, and walked away after saying a quick hello.

Before the headlining band played, I went outside behind the venue to get high with my husband's singer and a few other. When we came back in for the set, there was hardly anyone left in the venue. It was just our group, guys from one other band and the girls from earlier. Nobody else came to see the headlining band despite their claim of popularity. The weed kicked in pretty quickly and I was feeling mellow, so instead of trying to start or be a part of a pit, I stood close to the stage and leaned against the wall. They were just not a band you can mosh to, anyway.

During their set, the singer kept coming over to me and singing to me, at some points getting close enough to my face that I could smell his breath. He did the same thing with the three girls but nowhere near as much. Every time he came up to me, I just laughed, both out of amusement and nervousness. He must have thought he was being charming or something, but at one point he did that weird thing where he tried to grab my chin and pull me closer (for a kiss?) and I pulled away. Like bruh, wtf? At one point he jumped off the stage and tried to dance with me while singing, to which my BF, who was shirtless and realized I wasn't sober, got between us and starting dancing with the singer instead.

After the set, I tried to head to the back of the venue with BF and his band. The singer of the headlining band stopped me and got all fake emotional. He said something along the lines of, ""It made me so happy to see how much you enjoyed our performance! I loved seeing you up front like that.""

I laughed and replied, ""dude, I'm fucking smacked right now. I needed the wall to keep me stable."" He got this disappointed look in his eyes and pulled me in for a hug. God, it was awkward. I stuck close to my boyfriend and avoided the singer for the rest of the night.

It must be a genre thing, because out of all the local/small time metal bands I've hung out with, not a single front man has acted like that. They're usually the chill type who I feel comfortable partying/getting smashed with. The headlining singer, on the other hand, gave me date rape vibes. I've never been made to feel more uncomfortable at a show than I did then.

On the flip side, the guitarist for the headlining band was super sweet and polite, almost in an apologetic way, and I really liked talking to him. It's just a shame he's associated with that particular front man.

Also I suplexed a friend into their merch table by mistake. 

I don't know. I get this feeling that there was something very off and I'm lucky that I was with a group of people I trusted because I didn't like how that lead singer made me feel.",0,0,0.0

Hey, I’m new here and I’m not really sure how this app works yet… but honestly, I’m just looking for a help or advice on what should I do. Things have been really heavy lately, and this kind of feels like my last hope to talk to someone who might understand. I don’t know if anyone will read this, but if you do thank you .
 I’ve been feeling really lost lately. I’ve reached a point where I’m starting to lose hope in being able to live peacefully in this world especially when it comes to dealing with men..
There’s something I’ve never really shared with anyone. When I was around 8 or 9 years old, I was SAed by a family member during a sleepover at my cousin’s house. At that time, I didn’t even know what SA was. My parents never talked to me about these things, so I thought what happened was normal. That’s why I never told anyone.
As I grew older, I started to realize the weight of what happened. I began to struggle with depression ,anxiety and trust issues , but I still haven’t been able to tell my parents even after all those years. It’s something that has been silently eating at me for years. My anxiety has only gotten worse over time especially because I’ve been constantly harassed just for going outside. Every time I try to feel okay or act like I’m happy and safe, something happens that reminds me I’m not. It’s like I’m trapped in this fear that I can’t escape.

I’ve always been on the thinner side. I used to eat a lot of chocolate and unhealthy foods but never seemed to gain weight. Then, when I started university, everything changed. I partied a lot, drank heavily, and, as a result, I gained a few pounds. I’m not sure exactly how much, but it wasn’t a huge shift—I went from a size 6 to a size 8.


I’ve been at this size for seven years now, and honestly, I’ve never felt fully comfortable in my own skin. I missed my old size, so I decided to make some changes. I started doing more cardio and cut back on alcohol. Slowly, I lost some weight and got back to a size 6, and I feel really proud of that accomplishment. When I look in the mirror or even just take a shower, I finally feel happy again. I feel like I’ve regained control over my body.


But people around me are making comments about my weight loss. It feels like I’m being judged for getting smaller, like I’m not allowed to be this size again. People are constantly asking if I’m eating enough or telling me to “put some meat on my bones.” It’s incredibly frustrating and makes me feel ashamed. It’s as if I’m constantly having to prove that I’m eating properly, almost as if people think I have an eating disorder.

My friends ended up dragging me away (it was 3AM, after all). In my drunken state, I never got his name or contact info.

The next morning, we were sharing stories (and trying to piece together the evening, as hungover fools do. Haha). Among my friends, it was all easily agreed this man was very into me, as I was in him. But nothing happened. Since being home, I’ve felt so heartbroken at a missed opportunity. I’m literally losing sleep, and find myself daydreaming about how our evening could have been if I had just been one less drink “sober”. I feel like I’m losing my mind, spending so much time thinking about a stranger. I’m a grown-ass woman, with a full life, and successful career. But this man.. something happened and he definitely got to me.

60,"I'm Obsessive and it worries me

I havent seen you in over a month at this point and it has me worried. Im sure its nothing. You probably just moved or found somewhere more convenient for what you need. I asked someone if it was okay for me to be worried because of how everything happened and they said it was fine, it just meant i was kind and i didnt seem obsessive... But the truth is i am obsessive. Since i first saw you a day hasnt gone by without you crossing my mind. I knew thats how i got but I tried to play it cool, but it tore me apart mentally. Its not your fault, i dont blame you because i know it was all me and my head. When we started talking i kept a notebook about all our interactions. For about 2 months i did that because i didnt want to miss or forget anything you said. I was off social media mostly but when we started talking i decided to see if you had any and i found your accounts. I didnt add any of them until i could do it without it seeming weird. I asked if it was okay to add you and you said yeah. We started texting through dms and it made me happy just to talk to you. There were a few times where i almost crashed out, sent messages i knew i would regret, asking for more, thinking only of myself. I guess it shows growth that this just fizzled out instead of blowing up because thats how it went before, burned bridges. Part of me hopes that because it did just fizzle that maybe i could try again in the future. I wrote many letters about how i truly feel what i want to say about it all and i want to send them but theres no avenue. You blocked me where we were talking. After that happened i was determined to let you make first contact and luckily i stuck to that. I saw you a few weeks later and you talked to me first. You offered an explanation but im not sure how much i believe it. I cant send it on other platforms because you never gave them to me, i found themself and never told you. Obsessive. Im afraid the only thing keeping me from being a stalker is the self awareness i have about the situation. Im off all social media again because i know id just be looking at your profiles. Obsessive. That last day we talked, i hope that is the only time you saw how obsessive i could be. I waited around, like a creep, a stalker, just to see you and talk to you. Im fairly certain you were aware of this and im sorry i put you in that situation, it couldnt have been easy and was probably scary. I know where you work, but i never looked for that, somebody else told me about it, i didnt want to know because if you wanted me to know you wouldve told me, and you never did. I dont go there, i know how it would look. I ask about you sometimes to other people, people who may have seen you. I dont want to be obsessed with you, i dont want to think about you every single day, i dont want to be obsessive like this. Is it okay that im worried about you after it's been so long? Was it ever okay to be worried about you when we were barely even friends? The truth is I am obsessive. I am aware of that... And maybe im more than obsessive and im just afraid to admit it because of what it would mean. I stay away to stop the tendencies i have. Im not looking for you, im not following you, but you are on my mind. I am obsessive, but i dont want to be ..",0,0,0.0
61,"my first kiss

i feel like my first kiss was stolen from me. i was was 19 and had never kissed anyone before. i had been at a party when a friend of a friend who i kinda knew saw me sitting alone outside and came to sit with me - i was going through a really difficult time in my life then and i was being a very emotional drunk - i was really upset and was just drunkenly rambling and i somehow ended up telling him about how i've never kissed anyone and how i felt like i was unlovable and undesirable. he made sure i was okay and we went back inside - for the rest of the night my friends say they could tell he looked like he was wanting to make a move, but i was super drunk and couldn't tell, and im oblivious to that stuff even at the best of times. 

the next night, my friends and i were at a club with a big group of friends and he was there - we ended up dancing together. i was, once again, very drunk and didn't think anything of it. my friends tried to get between us and get him away from me because they weren't happy with what was happening, but it didn't work - we were just dancing together and then before i know it he takes my chin in his hand and kisses me. I didnt push him away or anything because I was really drunk and not really all there and i just kinda went with it and kissed him back.

i feel kinda icky about it and taken advantage of in a way, but i think what makes me feel worse is the fact that it was my first kiss. that's not how i wanted my first kiss to be at all, but i feel like i got no say in the matter at all, and now I'll never get to experience that 'first kiss' moment and that makes me really sad.",1,1,1.0

63,"Don't know how to feel about this situation with my dad.

I'm 27(f) and my birthday just passed. This year my dad moved away with his wife and my sister because she got a work transfer which was a huge shock to me. It happened with 2 months notice. I didn't even get to say goodbye to his wife she was already gone 3 days after she got the offer. 
My dad doesnt really have a job, he used to do odd jobs here with his friends who are self employed and that was enough to keep my dad comfortable. (Not saving) just able to live and keep up with his wife's fancy lifestyle. She on the other hand makes a fair amount of money and has for the last decade while my dad was a SAHD.  He took my sister around everywhere she was enrolled in something everyday and he took her to and from school and to all of these clubs and activities and such. 
I watched some of his proudest moments in this last decade and some or his hardest. 
They bought a house and got a pool, paid to have the ground leveled for it. I think they thought they were staying..
He bought his dream (a motorcycle and he'd never driven one in his life) 
It was a good price but he never drove it.
Then covid happened, and everything here got weird. He stayed unvaxed (so did i) and his wife got the vaccination manditory to keep working. 
...
Then the house down the road from them sold and they started being like wow..we can't afford to live here when we could sell our house. 
As it was my dad was already beginning to struggle because most self employed people struggled throughout covid, and he was just helping out.
Eventually their house did sell, and they moved in somewhere closeby. They didn't stay there for long though because now their halfway across province, which might feel like nothing to some people but he can't drive that far and I don't drive at all...
Ffw; almost a year they've been gone so I know my dad must be struggling financially alot because he's had no income and is trying to live off of whatever money he was given for the time being off of the sale of the house.
(All I know is that the majority of it went into a bank savings account.) 
My Christmas present was kind of crappy but I thought way too much about how I felt about it then the actual situation, because the presents he gives me are usually awesome and I was spoiled in that way, I realize this now. so here is this. 
I owed my dad 100$ collectively, over the last month. I borrowed money twice and so, I paid it back just before my birthday...
When he came down this time, my birthday present was very comparable to the Christmas present, however in the card he put 100$, which made me feel so freaking sad..
The thing i don't understand is, did he give me this because I paid him back, so he was able to afford giving this to me? He's going on vacation at the end of the week for a week and I don't know how he's managing that, but I can't help feel the direct connection between me giving him the 100$ on Tuesday and it winding up in my card on Friday..I just don't want it to be like that I wish he'd given me 50$ or anything so it didn't feel so directly connected...
I don't have alot of money either but I still get some...and I really don't know what his finances are, but I know when his money is gone its gone  and I want my dad to be able to enjoy things while he's going out watching his wife enjoy herself, and doing everything for my sister.
 They completely separate finances as far as tiny amounts of money <1$ CAD.
I know he pays for his own everything and I hope he isn't just digging a hole for himself. I love him more then anything and he is such a great and selfless dad. 


TLDR; I owed my dad 100$ I paid it back on Tuesday and on Friday 100$ showed up in my birthday card. I don't want my dad to be living that tightly and I'd rather give him back the money if it's actually like that but other then the massive subliminal message I know he'd never outright tell me that. I just don't understand and feel really sad because he's far away and making less and less of an effort to include me.",1,1,1.0
64,"I truly believe my friend would be alive today if she just left her husband

My friend took her own life instead of  separating/divorcing her husband.

You know how sometimes you stay in a relationship longer than you should… and it’s not until you’re finally out of it that you realize how toxic it is?
Yeah, I’m pretty sure my friend was in that situation.

I did not talk to her husband much, but the few times I met him I thought he was ok. I was always concerned with the fact that he wasn’t working, and that he was completely ok with my friend covering the cost for everything (including my husband one time, when we went out to dinner, the check came, my friend was in the restroom and her husband just shrugged his shoulders saying he didn’t have any money… yeah… my husband thought he was a real piece of shit at that moment).

It seemed to me their marriage started off ok, supportive, they were both happy, he genuinely loved and cared for her and she deserved that. However for some reason he did not work for almost 10 years… just because she said she didn’t mind being the breadwinner, doesn’t mean she was happy with being the sole earner. That should be obvious right? Especially in today’s economy!!?

I talked to her almost everyday. Over the years I heard her resentment build up towards him. Towards the end she was a shell of herself, more quiet, reserved, no more expression of anger-it broke my heart.
She really wanted to leave him, to the point where she packed her important belongings and booked a one way ticket. I thought she just needed to distance herself from her husband to figure out what she wanted. She told me she resented him and didn’t love him anymore, she just wanted to divorce and was already thinking about another. I was so hopeful she was on a path towards more positivity…

I couldn’t believe the news about my friend when I heard it from her husband. It took awhile to sink in, but while I was trying to grieve, I felt suffocated by his emotions. He expressed his frustration towards her, and confusion, he couldn’t understand why she would have been in such despair…
This was extremely frustrating to me, especially with all the shit my friend told me about. How could anyone be happy with a deadbeat husband at home while they were working two jobs and trying to pay off debt? I cannot believe when she suggested he get a job, his response was “but who will take care of you and the dogs?”
All of the “solutions” he provided involved his poor mother paying for things (including their debt) as well as being emotionally supportive while she was trying to find other jobs.

To this day he still complains about the burdens he is left with. He calls the debt “her debt” when in reality they would not have even had debt if he fucking worked.
After she died he told me about all the times he would head over to a bar to enjoy a drink… again I was extremely frustrated because it seemed easier to eat and drink on her dime rather than try and figure out how to be a fucking adult and get things done.

Also, I am not his friend, I was not even married to him and I was already feeling overwhelmed by him and his emotions. I cannot even imagine how my friend must have felt dealing with his insecurities while she was trying to deal with her own depression.

Reddit, apologies for being all over the place. I just want to say if you’re feeling trapped in a relationship, or if you feel stuck and like you’re not “building a future” with someone, please please do not follow my friends footsteps. 
Please consider couples counseling, individual counseling, or leaving the person. 

She was such a joy to be around and brilliant, I will miss her forever.

I already posted a letter to him/reddit with more colorful language incase anyone is interested. I found it extremely therapeutic. I’m scared because he uses reddit, but I need to grieve in my own way.",5,14,0.35714285714285715
65,"Being with a nice guy isn’t great

Secret profile so that my main account is not recognized.

I am a female in her 30s recently in a 7 month relationship. Partner is male in his 30s as well. I entered this relationship after a very traumatic one filled with abuse for many years thinking that finally choosing a nice guy would be great.

It's not.

We moved in together recently and I have been questioning if I can make this work everyday. I keep telling myself I can fall in love. I keep telling myself this can get better. As each day passes though, it gets harder to not show my extreme irritation and desire to be left alone. I feel like an ungrateful human.

It all starts with, even though he's very nice, he thinks he has superior intellect to most. How companies should pay him excessively for ""his mind"". Mind you I've watched his work quality and work ethic several times since he works remotely and he's not that great. He walks away from his computer all the time to drone on about shit that bores the shit out of me or fails to meet work guidelines and makes so many excuses for it. All he does, his main topic of conversation, his reason for existing, is the financial field. I'm an artistic type and major in history so hearing this over and over and over everyday is slowly driving me insane. He knows I have no idea what the hell he is talking about. 

I am also a severe introvert. He's an extrovert. He verbalizes every single thought he has. EVERY SINGLE ONE. Even TMi thoughts like bowel movements and such. He apparently doesn't believe in comfortable silence. Even if we're in the car driving somewhere, he will verbalize his thoughts on road laws, his gas, and every other mundane thing possible. When we are home, even after I gently remind him that I need time to decompress and recharge, he finds every single thing possible to basically violate my quiet time because he ""just always wants to be around me"". Oh yes, did i mention he basically smothers me. Cannot leave me alone. Wants to talk on the phone if he's not home until he gets home and then proceed to talk endlessly when he gets home. Again about stuff I have no idea about or verbalizing every thought that comes into his head.

He has poor hygiene. POOR. Does not shower often. Does not brush his teeth. Worst of all does not wipe his butt. I'm sick of his disgusting underwear. He leaves his filthy clothes everywhere for me to pick up and smells horrendous sometimes at night to the point I am physically gagging and trying
Not throw up. With said poor hygiene he wants to have sex.. and in my mind all I can do is freak out about the possibility of his skid marks all over the sheets.

Have I gently told him what bothers me? Yes. Have I expressed my frustration? Yes.

But he's the nice guy, right? Won't cheat. Won't raise his voice. Sometimes opens doors. 

I thought the nice guy would be great. It's not. I'm losing my sanity.

66,"I feel guilty talking about good things in life to my friends.

TW: Self harm, suicidal thoughts.

I recently turned 30, and after a long time I am finally getting my footing in life. For most of my life I have been battling mental illness, as well as multiple physical aliments. I struggled a lot, and honestly never thought I would make it to 18, let alone 30.

I started my struggle very early. I was pulled from school to be home schooled in grade 7, after bullying in school got so bad I had thoughts of suicide. I did return to school for high school, and luckily the bullying did not continue. However, at this point my mental health declined further, and I attempted suicide three times. Luckily I didn't succeed, mainly due to my friends and parents.

After high school I struggled more. I moved out of my parents house (big mistake) and moved in with roommates. Well as you might expect that didn't go well either. I ended up moving back home after I had seizures and was unable to work.

After the seizures, well life unfortunately got worse. I became even more sick, and was eventually diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome. (Which literally just means you vomit with no apparent cause). Doctors couldn't help me, and I was left to suffer. I vomited multiple times a day, every day.

On top of it all, the seizures seemed to make my misophonia worse (to an extreme amount), any noise made my blood boil, or would make me feel like crying. I lived in a large city, where you could almost always hear traffic. My room was right above the living room as well, and as hard as my parents tried to accommodate me, I was living in hell.

I did attempt to go back to work. I tried so hard, to the point where I was having panic attacks daily. Eventually I had to stop working all together.

I won't go into every detail, but this will give a rough idea of what I was living with.

I've been incredibly lucky to have amazing parents who have supported me. They helped me get on disability when I couldn't work. They allow me to live with them, and they are always supportive.  Almost 2 years ago, my parents and I moved. We moved to a quiet little town, and I am loving it.

  
Fast forward to now.

I am currently living in a separate area from my parents that we are making into an apartment for me. The quiet town means I rarely hear traffic. It feels amazing to not be on edge 24/7.

My doctors and I have finally worked with the medication enough to allow me to be stable. I know that medication will never make me 100%, but now I am not having the extreme downs I was having before.

I rarely vomit anymore, maybe once or twice a month.

I am working on getting my driver's license

I got accepted to go to college part time (online), where I can work at my own pace.

I am finally feeling like I can plan for the future, unlike before where everything was so bleak. The best way I can describe it is like for the first time I can see my future in colour, instead of a grey bleakness.

  
However, my friends haven't been as lucky. I feel horrible, but I know all I can do is be there and support them.

My friends were there for me when I was at my worst, and I want them to be able to see me at my best. However, I feel guilty, like if I talk about it I am rubbing it in their faces or something.

I know my friends most likely don't think like that, but the guilt still weighs on me.",1,2,0.5

68,"Love is cruel, embarrassing and humbling.

A long love (?) letter? A way to clear my mind and maybe one day find some happiness again, whatever that may be. I don’t blame people for not reading this, it’s way too long. Hey, my therapist told me to write, so here I am. 

Have you ever loved someone so deeply yet carry the slightest feeling of loneliness? This yearning to truly know the inner workings of this person’s mind and they just won’t let you in? They feel like “the one”, yet you constantly question it, you yearn to know every single thought and emotion this person experiences. You wish to know every little detail of their past and present day to day life. You carry this hope that one day they will let you in and you dream of a future with this person you love so deeply. Because you have never and may never love someone that deeply ever again. Until you reach a point where time starts to pass and the pressure builds. This ever so present and lingering pressure to know right now, to make a decision for the rest of your life. Marriage and kids, the looming biological clock. You spend weeks in pain, not eating, pulling your hair out thinking about if and how you can possibly leave someone that you love deeper than you ever could’ve imagined? The relationship feels stuck and the person you love more than anything in the world doesn’t want to grow? They are stuck on the tracks. Lying incapacitated, watching as the impending crash fast approaches. We both know it’s coming and we can’t fix it. Was it me not being patient enough? Did I give up too soon? Am I the avoidant for running away from this, or are you for refusing to have the hard conversations we so desperately needed to have? How will I ever love again, because no matter how hard I have tried, I feel sick at the thought of loving someone else. It’s so sad to see two people, in the end, cause each other so much pain. Two people that once loved each other so deeply, although one often doubted the others love. The insecurities rearing it’s ugly head when alcohol was involved. All from the one who wouldn’t let the other in. I often wonder who put the other through more pain? The one who left when things got hard and seemed ireperable? Or the person who drug the other, who was desperate to fix their “mistake”, through the mud for months on end? Almost an entire year. I often think it’s the latter, as I sit here in constant pain while you appear to have moved on and fallen fast and hard for someone within a couple months. I thought if I let you treat me poorly for months it would prove how serious I was. That you truly were the only person I wanted to be with and I truly regretted my decision. When you asked to come over and kissed me and tried to rekindle things one last time, that was nothing but a brief reprieve from the pain I had been experiencing. In the end, you grew immediately distant and dragged things on for a couple months, only to immediately block me out of your life without a conversation. All this after I begged you to end things with a conversation if that truly wasn’t what you wanted. Communication was never your strength, and at times it wasn’t mine, but I was always willing to try and grow. From lovers to strangers. How can two people who were the world to each other simultaneously break each others hearts and hold such animosity towards each other? I’ll always carry the guilt of breaking up, but how guilty should I feel when the person that wouldn’t let me in tells me “why do I need to work on anything, you broke up with me?”. There is nothing more crushing than loving someone so deeply who refuses to truly let you into their mind and grow with you. Yet, even though this person is seeing someone else now, I feel like I would take her back if she was willing to grow. I don’t know why. This person let me into the depths of their heart but never their mind. Why am I still hanging on, why does my heart still hurt? It’s embarrassing. Is it the hope and a dream of a future where you’ve truly let me in? One that may have never came, even if we never broke up? I would have lived the rest of my life hoping, just to be with you. Fifteen months after the break up and I, the one who originally ended things, sit here struggling as you appear to give your heart to someone else. I want to be happy for you, but I can’t. I just can’t after how you treated me. The only way I could withhold resentment is if we were together, but that seems next to impossible now. I think it is impossible. Was the breakup a valid excuse for you to drag me through months and months of pain while giving me some hope? How crazy is that? Love is fucking crazy.",1,2,0.5

I like having natural conversations with my boyfriend, both over text and in real life. But I don’t really get that from him. He’s a dry texter and when we hang out in person, he rarely smiles or holds my hand unless I reach for his first. I send him cute stuff, and he just reacts with a checkmark. He never sends anything cute back. He doesn’t flirt, compliment me or say anything sweet.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m overthinking it but is it wrong to want those things? I thought maybe he’s just stressed, he recently moved to a new apartment, has a little financial pressure and also struggles with germophobia. That’s why I never brought it up or told him what I wish I could get from him emotionally.

But he has said some really hurtful things too. During arguments, he’s called me “R word” and “dumb.” He says I fight over small things. I try to help him when he asks questions—even things he could Google—but when I take time to find answers, he tells me he could’ve done it himself. He says I don’t have presence of mind, and blames my “dumbness” for things going wrong.

He says couples should uplift each other, but he also says that being with me is the opposite of that. Once, he even said it’s a disaster when we’re together.

Hey Ishika,

If you ever read this—I don’t even know if you ever will—but I’m sorry. I might be drunk while typing this, but maybe that’s the only way I can finally get this off my chest.

I didn’t know how to handle the love we had. With everything that happened—your mom and my dad’s affair—I was lost. I didn’t know what to do, how to react, how to protect what we had. But through it all, you loved me the right way. You loved me the most.

After we ended, I got into another relationship. And that’s when it hit me—how rare you were. That girl cheated on me. And it wasn’t karma because I cheated or anything like that—because I didn’t. I never cheated on you, Ishu. But maybe it was karma for walking away from someone who gave me such sincere, unapologetic love.

Not everyone knows how to value that kind of love. I didn’t—at least not then.

If I had the choice now, I’d marry you in a heartbeat. I’d fight the entire world for you. But I know all you have for me now is hatred. And I get it. I deserve it.

Every time I come back home, I’m hit with memories. The corners where we sat. The way you’d snort when you laughed. My dog loved you more than she ever loved me—and she’s not here anymore either. Just like you.

Coming back to this house, walking these streets—it’s both haunting and beautiful. I know you’d never want anything to do with me again. I’ve accepted that. And maybe someday I’ll find someone new, and I’ll love her in my own way.

But you were different. You were special. The kind of once-in-a-lifetime love people write about.

If there’s a second life, I’d fight every damn thing to have it with you. In this one, I’d be grateful just to see you once in five years… even as a stranger I silently wish well for.

I don't like the guy, my mom says that he just looks and acts like a jerk but i genuinely think that he don't give a shit about me and have absolutely no respect towards me. I don't feel good whenever i'm around him and we also have gotten into small arguements over the years, my mom stood in sometimes. I think she choose a wrong partner but i'm in no charge of dealing with that, my ultimate solution i guess is to move away and stay afar from them as long as possible, it's sad but i can't think of another possible option in this scenario.

Hi, I'm 24(F) and I've not had any irl friendships in over 6 years. When i had irl friends i planned every meet up, paied for everything.

T he irl friends just ghosted me but are still really close friends with eachother.I had a group of friends I met on twitter in late 2020 but after a year they broke off in smaller groups of people who live near each other. I don't live any where near those people so the messages kinda stopped.

Have you ever felt like you're always there for others—every time they need someone, you're just a message away, always ready to help, listen, support? But when you need someone, there's no one there. Not even the person you prioritized above everything and everyone else.

I’m a man, and I know we're often expected to “stay strong” or “deal with it,” but sometimes, I just want to talk. I recently reached out to someone—someone I’ve done everything I could for—because I was really not okay. And they said, ""I’m also going through something."" And I get that. I really do. Everyone has their own struggles. But is it selfish to wish that just once… they’d put me first? The way I always did for them?

78,"being cheated on is traumatic asf

On Friday, I found out the guy I dated for the past 4 years had hidden text messages on their Apple Watch with someone under a guy’s name. I guess his Apple Watch failed him by not syncing with the deleted messages from his phone. I saw what I saw and the messages were too specific to not be him, regardless of how much he tried to deny and manipulate the situation when I confronted him. He claimed being hacked, claimed to still love me, claimed to want to propose to me and because of all of this, he kept telling me there’d be no reason to cheat. Idk why I thought he’d respect me enough to give me the truth when cheaters are not respectful to begin with. I really have to come to terms with the fact that I’ll never get closure, and that being my closure.

Being manipulated, gaslighted, having my boundaries crossed after telling him not to reach out to me anymore- it’s been very traumatic. Today I had to get an STD test to make sure I’m okay. That was traumatic. When I went to block him on social media, I saw that he changed his profile picture to one that I took of him on our anniversary a couple years ago. Just wow…

After spending a long time getting over my ex and dealing with constant issues that almost ruined my life, I finally decided to try dating again. Months went by with no luck—no real connections, barely even contact with anyone—and then, out of nowhere, she appeared. It felt like something out of a fairy tale. She was like a goddess straight out of my dreams. I fell for her instantly.

We went on a spontaneous first date, and from there, it was like history wrote itself. We spent so many days in a row together that I honestly can’t even remember a time we weren’t with each other. We clicked on everything—interests, values, humor, the way we talked. It felt effortless. This was truly the dream girl I never thought I’d find.

Eventually, we became exclusive. We started making real future plans. It felt secure, genuine, and real. But just as magically as it all began, it ended. I won’t get into every detail, but I found out she was still talking to and seeing multiple other guys—even while crying to me, telling me she was ready to die for me. The betrayal was unreal.

I kicked her out. She begged me to forgive her, swore up and down that she was sorry, but honestly? I was shattered. I’ve been through so much pain and heartbreak already, and I finally felt like I had something real—only to have it torn away like it was nothing.

(M23) (F21) 4 years

Closure or control


So I (M23) was in a 4-year relationship that ended about 2.5 months ago. She (F21) broke up with me over text while I was at work, with no real conversation, no closure, and pretty much vanished. I went full No Contact since, trying to heal and move on. She never reached out. I waited… and I waited.
This week we saw each other again briefly (in a respectful setting), and I finally opened the door for a mature conversation—something real, where we could both be heard.
Her response?
“I can’t have a mature talk with you face to face. Out of respect, I want to hear what you have to say. But don’t expect me to reply. If you’re not ready to talk without getting a response, then please don’t say anything.”
That was it.
She also added that she already “said everything” in a previous message to my sister and that “nothing will change how she feels anytime soon.”
I was calm. I didn’t rage. I told her I’m not asking for a stage—I just wanted a conversation, not a monologue. Since she wasn’t open to that, I said I wouldn’t speak just to talk to myself.
That’s how we ended.
It hurts because I still had hope for a real conversation—not necessarily to rekindle, but to end it right. But now I’m left thinking… was she ever emotionally mature enough to face herself? Or did she just want me to vent so she could feel better without doing the work?
So here’s my question to you all:
Was this her version of closure?

84,"Looksmaxxing is detrimental to mental health

“Perfection” depletes like the energy used to achieve it. And like time, it is delicately finite. True maximum human potential will never be about how attractive a man was in his youth. It’s about how in his death, that man will be remembered for being so fulfilled in his life, that none of his superficial, surface-level flaws had ever really mattered anyway. 

You’ll be the most beautiful the day you realize you always were.



I’m F19, and if you’re  older and don’t know what looksmaxxing is, it’s basically a community of teenagers and young adults online who have dedicated their lives to reaching ONE impossible standard. One idea of beauty. One set of facial features. Maybe back in the day, people used to just say someone have a “double chin,” but now they’ll say that their maxillary bone is recessed. And that’s only the surface. The looksmaxxing community has completely contextualized every single detail on the face, essentially brainrot terms. 

On the surface, looksmaxers are often young, immature, racist, homophobic, sexist, and cruel. They’ll comment on a social media post of a normal person and say things like, “it’s over for you, you have a negative canthal tilt.” 

And it used to be a joke. Maybe that’s how everyone on the outside sees it, but there’s such a dark aspect to the community.

Some of the looksmaxxers take a metaphorical pill in their brain. Black pill. Once you swallow it, you’ll be consumed by attaining an impossible standard. Ones not even the most attractive people in the world reach. All you’ll think about is how you can be the most perfect. The most beautiful. To the point where you don’t recognize yourself. And if you don’t? That means you’re doing it right.

Deep down, looksmaxxers are some of the most miserable people on the planet. They live in constant states of anxiety, disgust, and self hatred. While simultaneously and subconsciously judging other people and basing value entirely off of looks. 

It makes me sad that not more people are talking about it. These are just kids. And they’re ruining themselves.

91,"Lonely and ugly men visiting escorts, how has your life changed?

Hi All,

I am 28M, 5ft6 south asian immigrant in the uk - all of those attributes are basically the kiss of death in the dating space.

I have a decent income, career going ok, got a degree, now on a work visa, positive trajectory.

I don't want to reminisce over my loneliness but just for some context:

- Nobody wished me let alone celebrate my birthday for last 8 years abroad (except mum and dad)
- I got ghosted by so many women when i texted them.
- I got zombied by so many women when I texted them (they respond like 5 days later by that time I have lost interest not tryna be pushover).
- I became very ill once, vomited on the bed, called myself an uber, took me to emergency hospital, waited there for 10hrs, returned home with meds, cleaned and dried the bedsheet - all by my own, nobody was there for me.
- Perhaps due to my race idk, have had women give me the subhuman sideyes, random stranger women walking on same side of road change lanes the moment they see me.
- Have a profile on every dating app, been to 100+ meetup events irl, idk why I was cursed to be a 5ft6 brown immigrant but here we are.

I have kinda decided to jus say f**k it and go on a sex tourism tour across south asia (countries where it is legal btw). I wanted to do it here in england but too expensive. More value for money abroad.

You know what's funny? I grew up in a religious household with some ""morals"". My parents raised me with some values. All of that got eviscerated the day I downloaded a dating. I was raised to believe what matters on the inside, only to come to a country where masculity is dependent on your height. My eastern values withered away when faced with western practicalities of the real world. I always wanted to just get the love of one woman, start a family, tell my children how much I love their mum and how she means the world to me, make her my world - kinda like that scene from The Notebook where Rachel McAdams tells Ryan Gosling to build her dream house and he does. But I guess fate had other plans. Already so far behind in relationships compared to men and women my age.

So yeah, people who lost their virginity to escorts, who then visted escorts often repeatedly, did you have like dreams before? How was your experience? Do I have to like switch off a part of my brain when I visit escorts, knowing well this is a transactional paid activity with no connection? How did you manage the health and safety bit sleeping with randos often?

Finally, were you able to return to life ""as normal""? Like I am not a sex addict or anything, the only reason I am doing this is to play catch up with literally every man and woman around me - people often say you'll find someone who won't care abt your past (or absence thereof) but tbh the real life probability of that is like finding a needle in haystack. Once I am done with my paid for ""fuckboy phase"" that I deeply crave (I'd like to know what it feels like to be wanted and desired by women for once even though with escorts its fake I am fine with that), I would like to know if I will then be in the mentality to finally settle and get married to someone? I do want a loving wife and family and children, and in an alternative universe I perhaps would not be an immigrant would not be 5ft6 and brown, life would have been different - but like can at least try to start my family at somepoint after this phase? Or will my mental health worsen such that relationships will be messed up?

So yeah, how to sleep with escorts without catching STDs and can I get a real wife later?",0,1,0.0
92,"wearing glasses is not a political statement...and I'm tired of people acting like it is

Wearing glasses is not a political statement, in fact it's not even a fashion statement. I'm tired of being told I look better when I don't have full use of my vision. I'm tired of being made to feel like not wanting a headache all day every day is too much to ask for, because glasses is the easiest way to achieve this. And no, I cannot get contacts. They are not available in my prescription. It's honestly extremely condescending that you think you thought of that before I did. I KNOW pretty girls aren't supposed to wear glasses. I've had that message drilled into my head nonstop since I was about two. You're not smart or original for telling me I look better with my glasses off. Choosing to see well as often as I deserve to shouldn't be a political statement. I'm just trying to do the best I can with the only option I have available to me.

 It doesn't matter which frames I chose either, no matter how much time and energy I put into choosing flattering and stylish frames, someone isn't going to like them. People tell me not to take it personally, but how tf is that not supposed to be personal? You're not even allowed to tell someone you don't like their shirt without being considered an asshole, yet you don't even hesitate to tell me the medical device on my face that I paid hundreds of dollars for and wear daily is ugly and I should be ashamed of myself for owning it.  How would you react if someone tried to make you feel unattractive or less than because you chose to have clear vision? Not to mention how many people NEED glasses but are too self conscious to actually wear them because they know they're going to have to deal with shit like this. It's something everyone who wears glasses has to deal with at some point or another, so don't tell me it's not a big deal. Before you tell me to be less sensitive, and believe me I am working on that, you should tell the people judging me for needing glasses to be kind to others on the most basic level. I am just trying to see. That is it

EDIT: If you haven’t experienced this personally, I think that’s awesome. But the fact is a lot of people do.

94,"Why do narcissist abusers always accuse the people they are abusing of being narcissists?

Like what is that?

Narcissists are successful, are popular, and have these lives that look like everything was just handed to them on a platter. They don't usually struggle or have problems getting or, keeping a job because everyone likes them. Their partners are always looked down on by the other people in the abusers life because the abuser makes it look like their partner is lazy and selfish. This is how it is because narcissus know who to trick people into trusting them and believing them. Narcissists are charismatic.

You know how to tell someone isn't a Narcissist in a relationship? They're the stay at home parent, the military or corporate spouse that gave up their dreams to allow their partner to follow theirs instead and move them around the country. They don't have friends. They don't have a lot of positive experiences with others. They are usually disabled because narcs like finding disabled people to easily claim they are lazy. 

Narcissists don't listen to you, they don't trust you, they don't ever attempt to see things from your point of view. Because their needs and wants are the only things that matter. 

I've studied psychology and dealt with a lot of Narcissists. Grey walling doesn't hurt Narcissists. Because they don't actually care if you like them. They don't care if you don't respond to them. They don't ever feel lonely because they don't care about what anyone thinks of them as long as they keep getting what they want. 

I see a lot of people referring to Narcissists as leeches. Claiming they leech off of others. They don't. A narc would feel terrible about themselves if they couldn't see themselves as the provider, as the ""good person"". It would ruin their belief that they don't need anyone and that they earned everything themselves that they were given.

You can't get a narc drunk or drug them to get them to admit they are a narc. But you can get the victim of a narcissistic abuser to admit to anything as long as they don't have to be abused anymore. Most victims of narcissist start believing it when their abuser tells them it's narcissistic to have boundaries. They trust the abuser because they are older, wiser, have a better job, are respected and loved in the community. They believe they deserve to be hated because that's what their abuser says they should feel. 

If you are abusing someone because you believe they are a narcissist, they are not. If you are negatively interferring with someone's life because you believe they deserve it, they do not. You can't punish a narcissit socially, because you are targeting the wrong person. The narcissist will never be a target of harassment, or social ostracism because they can manipulate anyone into believing they are a great person.

If your first thought is to accuse someone of being a narcissist, stop and think. Because you are wrong. You won't catch a narcissist. You'll see and blame the person that was their trapped victim, their fall person, their decoy. You'll look at the narc and think, they've got it all together, they don't need help, they are being held back by the person who they claim is the narc. And most people believe it.

But don't. Just don't. 

Believe the single mom whose ex destroyed her life.
Believe spouse who had to leave their job for their spouse's job.
Believe the one kid on the playground that no one else will play with because they have cooties.
Believe the intern who says the superior sexually harassed her.
Believe the patient who says the doctor was abusive.
Believe the new employee who says the people they are working with are deliberately training them incorrectly.
Believe the customer who says your employee fucked up.
Believe your  partner when they say someone did something horrible to them, is now stalking them, and has been trying to sabotage their relationships.

You won't see the narc until you are their victim of abuse. You won't. They will always seem cold and logical. They will always be calm. They will never have points in time where you question whether they are a narcissist. Unless you look at the victim in their life. You'll see the narc based on how the person they blame is doing. Because that person will be flailing, they'll be drowing in life until the narc is out of it. They'll be scared, and alone, and hurting because the only people they will have in their lives are people who believe the narcissist. Heck, if the narcissist has enough influence in their victim's community, the victim may never be clear of their abuse because if the abuser convinces enough people that their victim was the narcissist, that victim may never be given the opportunity to really truly fully escape their abuser's slander. They'll never have the chance to ever be treated like they themselves aren't a narcissist. 

Just, think. Think before you acuse. Think before you hurt. Think before you harm. Think before you blame. And treat people like people regardless of your personal opinion. Because you not only might be wrong, you probably are.

96,"I'm in an open relationship... but I feel more alone than ever.

I'm in an open relationship with my wife. It was her idea — after more than a decade together, she felt I hadn’t really lived or experienced life beyond our relationship. Nobody’s breaking any rules. But still, I’ve realized I’m alone. And it hurts more than I expected.

I was a virgin until I was 20. She had at least two serious relationships before me. She had lived, explored, dated. I hadn’t.  
Six months into our relationship, I moved in with her family because it was closer to my university. Since then, we haven’t spent a single day apart — until recently.

She’s been my only partner, my only friend. I don’t really have friends. Just her, and one other person I talk to maybe once a month.

So when she suggested opening the relationship so I could also explore and experience life a bit more, I understood it came from a place of care. Like she was giving me permission to go and live a little. So I agreed.

Time passed, and someone came into her life. Someone who fit her preferences, just for something casual. Later, others showed up too, but she didn’t pursue more — she said she had already experienced what she needed.

Meanwhile, I haven’t had a single date. Not even a long conversation. No friends. No connection. I’ve tried everything. Apps. Servers. Hobbies. Real life, virtual life. I’ve put myself out there — nothing.

One day, I shared this with someone, and they said something that hit me hard:  
*“You don’t even get the bare minimum because you’re not even doing the bare minimum.”*

That wasn’t from my wife — it was an outsider. And it crushed me. Because I *am* trying. I just don’t know what more I can do.

The open relationship isn’t the problem. There’s no betrayal here. She hasn’t done anything wrong. But she had “luck,” in a way. She lived her part of the story. And it’s been over a year since then.

Now I’m living in a different city — a touristy place, full of people, bars, noise. But I moved here for family reasons, and for the first time in over 10 years, I’m apart from her.  
At first, I thought: *This is it. This is where things change.*

But after all this time, I realize I’m just… alone.  
Even with her support and the ""freedom pass"", I’ve been unable to make friends, connect with anyone, or build even a simple bond. I’ve joined gyms, tried meetups, dating apps, Discords, hobbies, forums. Nothing works. No one sticks. Not even neighbors.

And it's not that I expect things to just happen while I sit and wait — I've truly, actively tried. But I still feel like I’m shouting into the void.

Now that I’m far from my wife, I realize something: I feel lonely. Not just because I’m not in a relationship with someone else, but because even with someone by my side, I still feel like there’s a void. I can’t seem to find someone to even exchange five genuine messages with.

I’m still with her. I love her.  
But somehow… even in love, I feel alone.

98,"The Burden of Knowing Too Much

We should not overhear or over-read any conversation which is not meant for us..

Sometimes not knowing everything feels good,less worrying about a person for whom you care so much..its now always about the bf/gf stuffs but it's important to not a part of conversation that is not for you.. it's not for you maybe for a certain reason the universe doesn't want for you to find it..

But going against the universe and knowing it, you’ll only hurt yourself..

Because sometimes we know something but we cant do anything to make that good or even better,cannot confront the person because you already broke their trust and read /overhear it..

but crazy is you can only think how could the person supposed to save you,protect you,rescue you doing all that shit..

Its like they broke your trust but you can't even do anything,don't respect them like you were doing 

Just silent and thinking about it every night how could someone be doing that to you..

That's why i say

Never be a part of conversation which you shouldn't be.",0,0,0.0
99,"I got cheated on in an online virtual world and it's ended my inrl long term relationship

I'm beyond devastated and hurt.

My partner has been with me a number of years. It's been rough. I lost my job unfairly, which I had to go to court for. I then lost my cat unexpectantly, which sent me into a spiral of grief. Then one of our mutual friends killed himself.

I found out yesterday that my partner has cheated on me with someone he's met in an ""online avatar game/virtual world"" and has been speaking since March. Yes, literally two months and that was enough for him to cheat and say he has feelings for her.

All his friends are flabbergasted and can't understand why he's throwing away a long term relationship. Some have said comments on how it's a super downgrade (but this does not make me feel better) and honestly I'm just broken, and I don't know what to do any more.

I hate this. I've had everything taken from me and i just don't know how much more grief i can take.",0,0,0.0
100,"I lost all attraction toward my bf pls help…

Before you come at me I wanna say that my boyfriend (20) and I (19) are still together, i love him so much he is the best thing that ever happened to me. We’ve been together since April of 2023. I just need someone to talk to because every time i’ve spoke up to him about it, nothing changes and I don’t want to leave him but I think he’s manipulating me to stay with him… The story starts in may of 2023 my boyfriend graduated high school and he moves in with my family and I. He was going to go to college and continue playing football because that was his whole life and his passion but he decided he did not want to do that and instead work. He has an amazing job working on big machines and making Gears. I haven’t even graduated yet I got behind in school and dropped out and go to night school now and have 3 credits left. The first year of our relationship we had no issues, it was so romantic and the sparks were definitely there. Fast forward to I wanna say like October of 2024, I noticed he started gaining a lot of weight really fast, which didn’t bother me because i knew it was from not playing football or being active like he was before he graduated. I also put on a good 10 pounds so at the time i wasn’t worried. Around this time we were giving my mom money for alcoholic drinks every weekend. we would get drunk literally every weekend together. then he started having her get him drinks throughout the week. That’s when I really noticed his weight was going out of control and I knew he didn’t like the way he looked because the scale in our bathroom started collecting dust. Also he stopped caring about his hygiene and started to smell and not brush his teeth. I had told him to sit down with me and i expressed to him my deepest concerns about him because i was genuinely worried about his health and his drinking problem. i told him the sugary alcoholic drinks are what’s making you gain so much weight. like when i tell you guys he went through 2 packs of Mikes Hard Lemonade and 2 Packs of Twisted Tea in a whole 2 days i’m not joking. We were also eating out a lot getting fast food and he would order SO MUCH FOOD. for example, say we go to chickfil a’ i would get the sandwich meal with a medium drink and he would be ordering a 30 piece nugget with a large fry large drink AND a sandwich. I always brushed it off because i mean what am i gonna say??? “Stop eating so much” absolutely not… When we talked about the situation he said he’s sorry and he is also concerned about his own health and would get a membership to the gym. I told him I would come with him but that means we would have to get up at like 5 in the morning and go because after i get of off work at 3 i have to head straight to night school so there’s really no other time for me to go to the gym with him, He said he’d just find a gym buddy instead. fast forward 2025 now… his weight is even worse this year. We have talked and talked about me not being as attracted to him anymore and i’ve gone as far as broke down crying in front of him because i feel so bad talking about it with him, i know it hurts his feelings. but i cannot imagine living a life without him, i just want him to stop drinking so much and get back to a healthy normal weight. “He said again I’ll start going to the gym I promise.” Its now March of 2025, my Dad passed away March 16th and it really has messed with my head a lot. I stopped caring about anything really. our relationship feels like we’re roommates, he’s there for me but like not?? It’s now April of 2025 he still hasn’t tried to loose weight he’s prolly a good 350-400 pounds. Even tho i offered to go to the gym with him it still never worked. I’m at a point in my life where i don’t care anymore and idk what to do about it, no matter how hard i tried to tell him i was genuinely worried about him and that i wanna grow together and have kids but he has to be healthy before that and drop some weight, He doesn’t care anymore either. Idk what to do I don’t want to leave him because I love him to death and he’s my best friend but that’s where i’m at if he doesn’t do something about it. i’m just not attracted to him physically or sexually anymore. Someone please give me advice. 🙏🏼🙏🏼 don’t say “ we’ll just talk to him again” I HAVE!!!! 5 different times.",4,11,0.36363636363636365
