My daughter responded to a Facebook posting for a rental and it was a scam. She online called the person out and then through messenger the person threaten to murder her and her Family. Put pictures of family members into the Facebook message.  It was reported to Facebook yet there’s been no action and I honestly I’m just disgusted on all levels angry and scared. I feel like I need an Uber geek….. yeah I’m so burnt out probably going to go off Facebook and I told her to also. Yet there’s a couple of groups that I really want to be part of so I’m just treading water at this time.  I am actually quite scared, this person may just be a scammer from another country yet the violence threatening to kill her father,  sister and other family members was a little bit over the top and they posted pictures of these family members.  Again Facebook did not respond. I asked Facebook to deactivate the persons profile and they said no reason to, it was OK.  Thanks for your patience and reading this to whoever did.

1,32,Late commet and only partially relevant I don't know if this was a one time message or situation has gotten worse but through reddit comments I saw the recommendation for The gift of fear by Gavin Debecker and its all about recognizing and predicting violent behavior but there's alot more about intuition and following it as we subconsciously recognize things. I also used to think of myself as a very aware of my surroundings person but since reading it I've realized I'm guilty of some of these habits. For instance getting on an elevator with a male stranger that makes you uncomfortable because you don't want to seem rude he points out what's sillier waiting a moment for the next elevator or getting into a soundproof steal box with a stranger you are afraid of.

I feel so hopeless about the future. I’m part of Gen Z, born 1998, and life is so exhausting. I have a college degree, but that’s basically useless unless I get into the graduate school that I applied for. I’m working a low paying job and can’t afford anything after paying off my student loan bills every month. I feel like such a burden to my parents because I can’t afford to live on my own. The future is so dreadful. There is a looming recession. Scientific research and development is being stifled and destroyed. More and more diseases are spreading. Nature will be destroyed by corporations. The orange shitler destroying America will make it impossible to live. Capitalism and Democracy is dead and were heading toward a technofeudalistic society or a total societal collapse. I would rather die than live as a slave to corporations. If there is nothing to look forward to in the future, then what even is the point of living? Isn’t that just prolonging suffering? I’m having more and more suicidal thoughts. I don’t see the point of being alive when the cost of living is so high and I can’t even afford to live anymore. Just being alive feels like such a heavy burden to carry.

Add to that the thought I'll never be able to change anything about this body I hate being stuck in so much (seriously fuck facial hair, I swear it makes me want to claw my own skin off), and the fact that the only thing getting me out of bed most days even before that shitshow of an election in November was just not having the energy to explain why I'm not doing anything, or to explain that most days I consider driving my car off a bridge but don't just because it wouldn't be worth the effort and the repair and medical expenses would put me in a situation ten thousand times worse if I didn't die after that.

Truly off my chest, fuck both of them, there are words and descriptions and thoughts on them that I surely cannot write on this thread, but to the maximum and most entire extent to which ill-will and misfortune can be projected at another person or object, I hate, disdain and truly denounce the existence of Trump and Putin along with all of the other twisted, cruel, selfish, money-hungry, grubby, dangerous soulless creatures that subject the people of this world to their atrocities.

2,10,"I spent the last few days trapped in a ""guys' fishing trip"" with my two older brothers, Luke (32) and Mark (39), and my father, Rick (61). We drove for an hour and a half into a sleepy Texas town—close enough to home to feel familiar but distant enough to remind me of everything I wasn't. Away from my boyfriend, Tyler, who has been my rock, my peace, my home for five years.

Family has always been complicated, an unsettling mixture of love and resentment. My dad, an army veteran turned civil servant, wears his conservative beliefs like armor, proud and unyielding. Mark mirrors him but with an added layer of chaos—unreliable jobs, reliance on food stamps, proudly and openly racist, a vocal Trump supporter who relishes in degrading jokes about minorities and immigrants. On this trip, their laughter over racist and xenophobic jokes echoed painfully in my ears. I swallowed my disgust, my rage, and my disappointment, saying nothing, hoping my silence would maintain some semblance of peace.

Growing up gay in our small, suffocatingly conservative town was a relentless nightmare. When I came out my sophomore year, exhausted from pretending, my father hurled the predictable hatred—""gay men spread AIDS,"" ""never under my roof."" My mother tried her best, but my father's harsh words always held more weight. It took years of distance and healing at college to bridge some of that divide. Slowly, even my dad softened, finally accepting Tyler as part of the family. For a moment, I thought we'd left the hurt behind.

Then came this trip, and suddenly everything unraveled again.

Late one night, after too many drinks, politics inevitably surfaced. Usually, I hold my tongue, but something broke inside when Greg Abbott's name came up. Without restraint, I exploded, ""I FUCKING HATE GREG ABBOTT. FUCK THAT MAN."" They laughed, unbothered, quickly shifting the conversation as if my outburst was just a minor inconvenience—nothing new or meaningful.

This morning at breakfast, the conversation returned to politics, painfully sober and starkly real. My dad, looking directly at me, praised Trump as the savior who would cleanse America from corruption. ""I know you don't like him,"" he said casually, almost baiting me to respond.

And I took the bait.

I detailed how Trump's anti-DEI stance threatened my mom’s civil service job, their sole source of income, potentially destroying our family farm. I spoke of his opposition to public education, the erosion of church-state separation, and, most personally devastating, the threat he posed to my right to marry Tyler—the man my dad had grown to accept as his son's partner.

My father, confident yet misinformed, insisted marriage rights were a ""state's decision."" Calmly, I corrected him with Obergefell v. Hodges. Mark fact-checked it, confirming I was right. My dad grew quiet, uncomfortable, as Mark awkwardly tried to comfort me with, ""Worst-case scenario, if Texas doesn't let you get married, there are like 40 other states you can go to.""

The gravity of his words took a moment to sink in. Then it hit me with brutal clarity—they wouldn't mind if I had to abandon Texas, our home, our history. For them, my exile would be merely an inconvenience solved by distance. I envisioned a ""destination wedding,"" realizing Mark's unreliable car and financial instability would never allow him to attend. My family isn't wealthy—could they even afford to visit? Would I want them there, knowing they’d let Texas push me away?

This revelation gnawed at me all day. Later, when I tried to talk it out with my dad on the phone, I explained how deeply Mark's ""solution"" wounded me. Instead of empathy, my dad doubled down: ""Your brother was just being realistic. We have to be prepared. And anyway, I still don't agree with it—God will judge your sins.""

It was like being sixteen again—scared, vulnerable, desperate for approval and acceptance. I felt utterly crushed. Defeated. Forgotten. It was painfully clear: they wouldn't fight for me, not really.

So here I am, lost and exhausted, tired of constantly justifying my existence, my love, my life. It feels like nothing has truly changed. My family would watch me go without protest.",0,"Neutral or irrelevant: Does not offer support, advice, empathy, or affirmation."
2,11,"Ever since seeing how the DNC responded to Bernie being popular in the 2020 primaries by shutting him out and forcing Biden on us I’ve been jaded. I usually just roll my eyes at people cheering for the democrats; I really wish we could all come together and ignore their performative stunts until they actually do some hard hitting stuff to stop the scary trajectory this country is on. 

I’m really getting to my limit of frustration with all of this Corey Booker love I’ve been seeing. This is the same guy that we collectively wrote off in the 2020 primaries because we realized how much money he was taking from big pharma, but suddenly we don’t care about that anymore? It’s great that he filibustered, but can we please stop acting like he’ll be a good president? We’ve had these mildly corrupt democratic presidents multiple times in the past few decades, and we’re still in the same place with a wannabe dictator for president. Isn’t it time to throw the current Dems in the trash and demand better politicians?

It feels like every time a democratic politician does the absolute bare minimum everyone suddenly forgets all the bad things about them, and we fall back into the same cycle of getting a centrist “progressive” president for a few years that does as little as possible, then we go straight back to a radical right wing president.

For context, we’re black Americans.

Now, obviously, Black America has its trials, tribulations, and issues. We have been the target of discriminatory practices and prejudice for as long as the United States has been a country.

Hearing about all the horrible things that happen to black people, whether by each other, by the system, or by people of other races, is obviously very scarring and mentally erosive. This is not to say that I don’t want to learn more about the history of black people’s struggle in this country. I just don’t want that to take away from who I am as a person, how I view the world, and my optimist nature.

It’s difficult—if I were to establish boundaries with my mom about saying this stuff to me about the doom and gloom that plagues the black community, she’d be offended and say I’m naive and not living in reality, so I never say anything—I just sit there and listen, sometimes tuning her out.

I get it. Black people have had the short end of the stick. I am black, and obviously these issues affect me. However, if there’s nothing I can do about it without putting myself or my family in serious danger, it’s just pointless. That’s how I see it. I can’t just spend my life just being constantly “woke” and aware of everything going on at the expense of my mental health, self-image, and even happiness—however fleeting it may be.

2,21,"I just want to go home. 

I’m a 20 year old American woman. In my childhood, Obama was president. And I remember the tears on my mother’s face when Trump came to office in 2016. 

In 2020, even though we were in lockdown, I felt secure. I know Biden wasn’t the best president, but he was a better option. 

In 2024, I was in my 3rd semester of college. I was driving people to polling stations that night, my friends and I were reassuring each other that the blue wave would wash over. But it never came. I didn’t want to get up the next morning. One of my professors cancelled his class, his daughter’s trans and is in New Mexico. I got warned on the way to my first class that fights were breaking out and to not go to the dining hall. 

My mom called me and I just broke down. We both live in blue states (New York and Oregon), but we can’t feel safe. 

I can’t even know where one of my friends is right now because they’re starting to go after student VISA’s. I’m seeing ICE take people off of the streets with no word of where they are. 

I’ve known I like girls my whole life but now I’m starting to fear that I may not get to be married. There’s states who want to take it away. I’ve already accepted that with DOE being dismantled that my hope of any child of mine having an education has gone out the window.

For God’s sake, my OBGYN told me to stock up on birth control that I don’t even take. She just wants me to have it just in case.  

The past few months have been hell. This is becoming a dictatorship.

I just want to be a kid again, when none of this was happening, where I could just crawl into my parents’ laps and watch a movie, not worrying about anything like this. I used to sing “This Land is Your Land” in school. It stings and brings tears to my eyes now.

2,23,"Many years ago, in the late 80s, one of my first jobs was working with disabled young adults.  These kids had all sorts of problems. From Autism (remember it was the 80s, that's what it was called then) to schizophrenia.  Among other conditions, I had students with FAS, CP, Epilepsy and even DS and intense anxiety caused by being the victim of infant sexual abuse.  

These kids, because of their conditions, would never 'handle' being in a normal school. They weren't going to learn history or geography. Many were non-verbal but were taught  (trained on) simple tasks. 

These kids were not going to be the ones out there running companies, making the big bucks, or even saving lives. But they did work.  Part of the program I worked in was 'worker training'.
We worked on 'matching', on 'sorting', on collecting, among other skills. 

Some of these kids worked at the local movie theater collecting tickets before a show.  Some at the local grocery store, stocking shelves. A few of the ones who had severely crippling anxiety got jobs doing janitorial work and other jobs with limited social interactions. 

While some might consider the jobs These kids did as beneath them, these kids were proud of their work, and they were always joyful and smiling.  They weren't going to be making a lot of money, and they would always have to live at home, or in a controlled environment  (group home), but these kids (and their parents) wanted to be working. 

Now, it seems that people are dx'ed with a disability. They realize that SS is not going to be enough.  They hear about the (potential) cuts.  And they still do not want to hear about getting a job. There are jobs available out there for people who may be considered to be disabled.  There are jobs that have limited interactions with other people for those who suffer from forms of crippling anxiety.  They hear about Trump's mass deportations, and yet (while now jobs have become available), they will still find a reason why they can not be employed. 

Imo... Some can work, and instead of being a productive member of society, they choose not to.  Their choice.  But if they do nothing to improve their position in life, they have no reason to complain. 

I also fully support periodical reviews of SS disabilities claims.  If the disability is caused by an injury, are you following treatment to recover? Is there the potential for recovery? Or are you wallowing in self pity? If a check is being collected for someone else, is that person still alive AND residing in the US?

The social security program has been abused and depleted. The steps that are being taken at this time are extreme but necessary. The steps currently being taken absolutely suck, but hopefully, an overhaul and reorganization of the program will help.

And before anyone attacks me for this post.

2.  I am not political. I have never  (and will never) share who I voted for.

Emphasizing the closing of borders is not to merely keep people out, but to lock us in. We are being systemically isolated from the rest of the world. Not just through censorship, but closing borders, reduced access to air travel, altering travel requirements and forms of ID, and reducing resources to relocate out of the country. This was shared from a German individual on #Globaltok on TikTok who says it is so obvious from the outside and they are discussing this in school regarding border policies and how censorship affects nations. 

The DEI criticism always confuses me. It includes disabilities, ageism, classism, women as a whole (including white women), religion (including Christianity) etc. It’s not just for POC or LGBT. The examples are always that and it upsets me bc it benefits so many types of people and Americans. We just talk the most about race and sexuality bc many people don’t like that they are being represented. It’s not about hiring unqualified people, it’s about encouraging work environments with qualified people from different backgrounds to improve the work culture and represent our value of inclusivity. Different types of people need to collaborate with each other more.

I’m scared for the Education system. We need strong educated Americans to determine what’s best for the future of country. It feels like they want us to be unintelligent so we are even easier to brainwash.

We are being censored and I’ve only been able to find out how other countries are protesting and what they are learning about the current state of America in school through specific hashtags and comments that are attempting to get shadowbanned on social media.

I was grateful that it was mostly accepting of LGBTQ+ people like myself, especially compared to the two countries both sides of my family immigrated from. For a long while, I even wanted to join the military.

Over the past several years, my patriotism has slowly withered away. I thought that Trump winning in 2016 was fluke. Awful, but surely it couldn’t happen again, right? I was hopeful when he lost in 2020, but then Jan 6th happened and Trump’s media presence didn’t diminish while he was out of office. Now he’s been elected again, and he’s threatening Canada of all places. Why the fuck would we want to annex and/or start a trade war with Canada?!? Like what the hell? 

I can’t be patriotic anymore, my patriotism is gone. Fear, anxiety, and rage are all that remain. A lot of people will say that this isn’t really America, that this isn’t what America stands for. I used to say that as well, but at what point does it stop being true? Trump managed to get elected president, TWICE. Approximately two-thirds of Americans either support his heinous actions or are dangerously apathetic. What does that say about us as a society?

At the same time I hate being grouped in with MAGA by other countries. I keep seeing people say that all Americans are complicit in Trump’s actions, even those of us who vote, call our representatives, attend protests, and generally do our best to stop these things from happening. I differentiate between citizens and their governments all the time, why doesn’t anybody else? I’m just as afraid as y’all are, I’m trans. If we get to the point where the American public is comfortable with invading Canada (I don’t think we’re at that point yet, but I really don’t know what the next few years will look like), I fear there would be few reservations about sending transgender Americans to concentration camps. We’re already deeply misunderstood by the majority of the population, even hated in many cases. The groundwork is already being laid with how they’re sending immigrants to Guantanamo Bay. If nobody is rioting over that, why would they riot for us? Despite all this, I understand why other countries are so hostile towards Americans right now. It’s a very understandable reaction. I’m not sure I can judge them for it, as saddening as it is.

I just can’t shake the feeling that something very, very bad is going to happen in the coming years. I feel it in my bones. Maybe it’s just anxiety. A lot of other people are going about their day-to-day lives, seemingly unconcerned, so maybe I’m crazy. I hope I’m crazy. I can’t shake this feeling though.

All of social media, people are saying that Canadians that travel to the US are bad Canadians. People are insinuating that Canadians are being detained at the border in droves, and that the government is advising against US travel - none of this is true. I agree that many of the people being detained at the border are being treated deplorably, and it is scary.

It drives me nuts that my side of the political aisle is using the alt right tactic of misinformation, conflation of the truth and outright sensationalism. This is not how we beat the other side. 

As for those guilting Canadians that continue to travel to the US, just stop. While I agree that Canadians need to take a stand, but it’s not going to be easy for Canadians to just stop travelling in the US.

It felt like talking to a stranger, and I guess, in a way, he is. I don't know him that well...

I thought he used to vote liberal or bloc quebecois, apparently not, he always voted conservative, I just didn't know because we didn't talk about it, so I assumed based on what he was saying. And if you think ''what is so shocking, conservatives are in no shortage in society'', yeah, sure, but this is quebec. The conservatives are not dominant here. Like, to give you an idea, Poilievre has been in the high negative popularity (like -50% kinda territory) in quebec since the start. Quebecers don't vote that much for conservatives and are rather socially progressive when it comes to things like human rights and social programs. And my dad never seemed THAT conservative... I'm gay, he never had an issue with that. He doesn't understand trans people though, but he also doesn't care, he says as long as they are adults he doesn't care. I guess I should have clued earlier he was more conservative given he was also anti vaccines and anti lockdowns during COVID and adhered to quite a few conspiracy theories, but It just is so surprising.

My father once supported Jack Layton, I remember how much he admired that man and was saddened by his death and he has expressed support for some rather radical progressive ideas too in the past. I feel a bit betrayed, but I don't know why. It's not like I didn't know he was right leaning... I just didn't realize the extent of it. We aren't that close either, but it feels so alien. To see him talk like that. I always thought he was better than this, better than a man willingly cheering for annexation by a foreign power. He naively believes it would make Quebec more independent too. I tried explaining to him that even if the U.S actually made us states and not just territories like puerto rico, Canada IS the most decentralised federation in the world. A canadian province has much more autonomy than a U.S state, and the canadian federal government has much less control than the U.S federal government has over their own country. He just denied it, but that's not my opinion, that's literally a fact I was taught in my political science classes in university. I'm doing a masters in philosophy, i'm not uneducated, he is, he never went past secondary school. I don't know how to process that I've basically lived my life believing him to be much less conservative than that. I thought he was center right, not alt-right.

I am so tired. Sitting here listening to the chatter of my coworkers and their clattering keyboards firing off yet another email and I can’t help but think… we are fucked. But we don’t have to be. 

Our country is in trouble. Big trouble. And we can’t just sit back and hope it all works out. We need to stand up. We need to fight for what’s right. What we were all taught by everyone from the veterans who lived in our culdesacs to our first grade teachers that we need to be fucking nice to each other and remember where we as a society have gone wrong before so we don’t do it again. 

Power, when left unchecked, gets worse. It doesn’t fix itself. Velveeta Voldemort? Surrounded by people who only say “yes.” They don’t question. They don’t push back. And it’s dangerous.

They want you to stay quiet. They want you to believe this is just “politics.” But it’s not. This is about America. About freedom. About the future.

History doesn’t remember the people who stood by and did nothing. It remembers the ones who stood up. Who spoke out. Who said, “Enough.”

Ask yourself: When things get worse, will you be able to say, “I did something”? Or will you pretend it’s not your problem? Will you sit by until you’re directly impacted? How many of your friends will be fired or disappeared before you look up from keeping your head down?

You might think you don’t have power. But you do. Your voice matters. Your choices matter. 

Every action—big or small—adds up.
We don’t need violence. We need courage. We need people who aren’t afraid to speak the truth. To push back. To demand better.
This is our moment.

Stand up. Speak out. Fight for America.

2,43,"I’m very, extremely sad and stressed out right now because I wanted to express my bereavement, that a Reddit user on here who I cared about so deeply, deleted her account and likely took her own life, as she said she would. I met her from a viral post on one subreddit about wanting to leave America. I correctly predicted that Trump was not the only thing causing her to feel so perpetually anxious, and that there had to be other factors in her life influencing her to be so anxious, and I was right. She later said that if she felt love was around her, she feels like she would not feel as much despair. 

She was so kind… I still cant get over the fact that she’s gone, only because of my ineptitude. There was so much hope for her. I could have let her known… 

If only I could properly express my grief… I wish I could turn back time and send the message that I didn’t send because I was overthinking and was so paralyzed by fear. I told her I wrote a message that broke the character limit— because I had THAT much to show for how much I care— and that I was going to send it as soon as I could BUT I DIDN'T. When she suggested splitting the message, yall, I realized I didn’t like how it looked and just kept overthinking about how to improve it. A day later, she messaged me that she was “mentally in the worst place imaginable and that your message would be greatly appreciated”— god I wish, I wish she still thought I was as kind as she said I was 🥲. And just wondered why I was gone… she could never imagine how much empathy I felt for her… she said I seemed so so kind. I was really happy and wanted to message her sm. I spent 13 hours hyperfixating on that message and writing it made me so excited, writing that message made me more happy than she will ever know now… bc it made me feel so cuddly. I cried for her and felt so deeply for her, and admired how much she cared abt the state of America. I wanted someone in my life who wouldn’t be desensitized by it all, I was gonna tell her how much I loved that about her, and how much I wanted to help her.

I didn’t bother to let her know that I was there, just pathologically overthinking how to improve it, because I wanted to surprise her with my message and tell her “Wait I’m here ⊂⁠(⁠･⁠ω⁠･⁠*⁠⊂⁠)“ 

But I know the pains of not hearing back from someone you really wanted to hear back from… I felt so sorry for keeping her waiting, and after about a week I felt so much dread that the meaning behind my message would crumble, and I started to overthink about how to apologize, and I started to feel a debilitating sense of anxiety that made me feel paranoid, restless, so nauseous my stomach hurt, and I was so tired I couldn’t do schoolwork. I regret so much not messaging her when I was feeling such an absurd amount of empathy, but I couldn’t think of how to put what I was feeling in words. I just wish I could hug her. I don’t know why I didn’t just tell her that… 

Now, I’m stuck writing out my sad thoughts of her to a small comment on a small thread few ppl will look at… 

I felt so much empathy for her I could barely believe it. Anyone who I admire and feel so much empathy for, has to be my friend. But now she’s gone. 

If I haven’t said it already, I wish I could turn back time. I loved her sm. She made me feel whole ever since I met her, and losing her after how happy writing that message made me, and how much I wanted to tell her… There is so much color in my life that has been lost. 

I am so infuriated with myself. 

I feel like I don’t have the energy to write this again. I’m so angry that I’m not allowed to post about this. My original post was much more releasing and I want to feel better. 

I can’t stand the fact she never got to hear i hyperfixated writing to her for 13 HOURS… I could only imagine how much it would have touched her. That I enjoyed writing that message for her that much. I remember realizing it was morning when my dog came downstairs and was surprised to see me. And she was happy to see me. Writing that message for you was a very pleasant memory, im so sad to see it turn into a memorial for someone i cared so deeply about.

I don’t want to ever forget about her but how can I find peace with myself? I was so desperate for the off chance she is still alive and somehow sees this post… but mainly just wanted ppl to make me feel better. I’m very stressed that I’m unable to fully get this off of my chest and have someone listen to me 🥺

I feel like I’ve lost so much color I don’t know if I will ever get back. I’ve always been very unique, overthinking but often feel a desire to write messages to kind people, but now it’s killing me.

When I read my message to her, I sound so loving, inspiring, bright, and creative. I can’t stand looking at it now.

The raw empathy and energy I showed from meeting her would have meant so much to her, now I feel like it’s been attacked. I’ve been severely wounded. It’s traumatizing. I feel like I’ll never get back what I lost when I found she deleted her account. I feel like I’ve lost innocence I didn’t know I had.

I’m a citizen of the USA. I’m a fairly patriotic guy, but I’ve always had a soft spot for Japan. Enough so that I filled out my college foreign language requirement with Japanese. 

So I’m here in Hiroshima. It’s actually my second time here. I was in my twenties when I visited the first time. 

It’s also the second time to the Peace Museum here. (If you’ve not heard of it, you should google it). 

The first time here it affected me, of course. But that was thirty years ago. And as a youth, the idea of dying seemed far away. 

Now I’m 53. My father passed in 2019. Death seems so much more real to me now. 

And this time the trip to the museum kicked me square in the ass. It was all I could do to not ugly cry.

My granddad was a Seabee and had participated in the invasion of Okinawa. He was, by all accounts, an easy going guy. But he never talked about the invasion. It must’ve been hell. 

He was slated for the first wave in the invasion of the main islands. There’s a lot to unpack with that, but suffice to say that that would’ve had a high mortality rate for both sides. So there’s a decent chance that if the bomb hadn’t dropped, I wouldn’t exist. 

So, where does that leave me? I guess I feel like I have an obligation to all the lives lost to bear witness to what we did. To try to honor their memory in my own small and insignificant way.

I’m writing this because I both want to vent at the wind and maybe to find just a sliver of hope within the words of a stranger. So here I go:  



I am so fucking tired of the this looming threat of wars. Literally every day or week I see some new headline with broken ceasefires or deals for “temporary peace” denied because of some bullshit excuse.  



The concept of war is being normalized everyday by definitions like “Economic War” or new recommendations in case of war-related catastrophes. 

 

I really, REALLY can’t shake of this feeling that something will happen if not this year, the next one; some kind of conflict between EU and US, which will basically give Ukraine to Russia and give the perfect excuse to China to invade Taiwan while all fucking world is busy sending people killing each other.  

I am so tired, that hate is winning; I am so tired that people are increasingly more justified on picking minorities and the frailer persons. When I see the news I see only despair and acceptance of the shitty situation the world is rapidly drifting in.   

Because of this, I literally can’t see my future; I can’t plan ANY kind of long term goal because why the fuck should I if could easily be sent to war or being bombed in the near future. And I’m not even touching the shit filled nest that is my personal and family life as every single year as of now is cadenced by a loss or sudden illness, which of course take the spot in my mind when I’m not thinking of this global mess.And now here’s the kicker, I literally can’t do jack shit about anything while I watch every situation in my life slowly leaning to a full crash: I am from EU so I am literally a bystander — at best, a pawn at worst — in all this charade; I’ve increasingly spent time with my family and hoped for a turn for the better, but this of course hasn’t spared me from having losses.  



I hope, every single day, for some kind of good news, some sign of peace and tranquility, but each prayer is met with a crushing reality check. I hate to waste days of hours feeling so overwhelmed by all of this that I can’t even do my work well or enjoy my free time.

It’s factually inaccurate trauma porn. The guy the movie was about is accused of SA by numerous people and the whole organization is really problematic.

2,67,"My “friend” thinks itd be funny if Trump became a dictator… 

Ive been having a back and force voice message convo with a friend after a problem back in february. I was trying to have a genuine conversation touching upon alot of topics, i dont generally have a problem with people having different beliefs than me and was looking to genuinly explore our differences to try and see what he sees and explain my view point on it or what not.

Everything was fine, some big differences but ultimately find some common ground something reasonable. Then i left a message about how many people genuinely believe Trump could run a third term and make himself a benevolent dictator and they're genuinly scared and i was curious what his take on that was and what to even tell people who think that who may be overreacting or maybe taking their disagreements too far.

And he responded back kind of laughing saying itd be crazy if it happened and wild, doesnt think it will, but that it would be pretty funny if trump became dictator and he wouldnt mind if he ran a 3rd term. That he's old and would likely die soon anyways and that he would need to make sure he does a good job to keep himself popular to even get there, but he thinks it wouldnt be as bad as everyone makes it out to be and it could be pretty hilarious...

I of course heard that and immediatly felt a si king feeling that this person im talking too just isnt that intelligent despite how much he thinks he is. I was looking past alot of the signs as the benifit of the doubt because i thought how could any genuine self proclaimed american would willingly give up their freedom to worship a dictator, but after that message and saying it so casually and off the cuff, my eyes kind of opened back up.

Ive been trying to find a middle ground, not to freak out, thinking its just like a bad looking storm that could pass and its not as bad as everyone/the media makes it out to be, that i can just go about my life and it isnt actually going thag route... or at least hopefully the full Hitler murder route... but just hearing someone who i thought i was having a genuine on the same page conversation with say that just broken that little fantasy i was telling myself...

Its like if someone jokingly admitted to wanting to commit murder to violate children, and they say it with a cheery tone like its all normal and ok... i dont like that and immediatly just stopped listening and sent back a message basically hardlining against it but im still thinking it.

And then for some random reason when i get home facebook decides to show me a memory of i picture i took if him in 2019.... he posted it on jan 6 2020 of him praying up to god basically and thanked me and just the association of jan 6 a year before it happened along with hearing that admission just really tugged at that... i understand people might want to judge me for saying this, but i wanted to share because i really really really do not want a dictatorship in America and i dont think we can convince peoppe that do to see the bad in it until after it goes down.",1,Supportive: Offers advice or suggestions to help cope.
2,68,"My grandma died a month ago. She was my favorite lady in the whole world. I miss her dearly. 
My grandpa and her were married for 60 years, basically. 

I went to visit my grandpa because I was on a business trip and staying with him was convenient plus I wanted to spend time with him for a couple days. 

My grandpa is obsessed with Trump and loves Fox News. He calls Trump ""Uncle Trump"", which I find to be disgusting. 

All day yesterday we were hanging out, with me indulging him with things he wanted to do for the day. I didn't mind and enjoyed myself. Even through his rants about how much he ""loves Elon Musk and how great of a job he's doing"". 

We got back to the house and then he sat down to watch Fox News and eat. I ate in a separate part of the house because I told him I didn't want to watch Fox. 

He came into the living room after he was done eating and exclaimed, ""Trump has just about saved the world!"" 

""Ohhh yeaaaah, sure he did"", I said sarcasticly. 

He then continued on to rant about how the Democrats are worthless with other choice words. I tried to talk to him about it, but he would just talk over me. It's pretty typical for him to just talk louder to drown out whatever it is someone that disagrees with him is saying. 

I then grew more frustrated and he could tell. He then uttered the words, ""That's why your grandmother died. She couldn't handle the Democrats losing the election and it killed her..!"" 

He then started to laugh. 

""Oh yeah, because it totally wasn't the cancer that killed her!"", I said. 

I left the room and cried. 

She died of metastisized breast cancer. It was everywhere. In her bones, liver, and lungs. Her lungs were being drained every 3 days for the last month before she died. Her breathing was labored and her chest heaved with every single breath she took. She tried every chemo drug there was to combat the spread and overtaking. Even the highest dose one that made all of her hair fall out.

She developed sepsis twice because of the chemo port in her hand. They had to remove it after she recieved her antibiotics. No more chemo. This was it, the end. 

Hospice was sent to the house with a hospital bed and an air tank for oxygen. The nurses were taking care of her every day and making sure she was okay.

To see her body become thin, frail, jaundiced was hard. She was delusional and falling in and out of sleep a lot. She only ate about a handful food a day, sometimes none. She mostly drank sodas and slept. 

It was hard to watch her actively die, but I was so happy I got to see her twice before she passed and spend some time with her. 

The illusion of who I thought was one of the best examples of a good man in my life, was broken. 

I didn't understand how he could utter these disgusting words out of his mouth when earlier that day he told me he ""couldn't even say her name without tearing up and getting emotional"". I was really confused and upset. 

Then I came to the realization that my grandma was the one who made him into what I thought was a good man. Now that she is gone, she isn't there to shame his behavior or educate him about the way the world is. 

She told me before she passed away, while bed ridden that she marched and protested many times in Washington DC. She saw what was happening to the country and said, ""Buckle up, sweet girl, because the ride is going to get wild."" I miss her so much.

My view is forever changed of him and it breaks my heart into tiny pieces.",1,Supportive: Offers advice or suggestions to help cope.
2,69,"Disclaimer, I'm Autistic with ADHD. I have been such since I was born, and always will be. I am not high functioning, I am not low functioning. Those terms have fallen out of favour for a reason because the spectrum is not a black and white line that says ""good Autism, bad Autism."" It was made simply to determine whether we are ""useful"" to an NT-dominant society. This post is gonna be long winded as I try to explain my feelings. 

NT means Neurotypical, which is simply described as having common neurological development and functioning, the antonym of Neurodivergent.

A lot of things terrified me about Bobby Kennedy's speech. The dehumanization, the bigotry, the sheer eugenics that even made evil companies like Autism Speaks condemn him. What terrified me more is the sheer amount of agreement with him that I've seen. That we destroy families, that we need a ""cure"" because we're somehow inherently broken, that we cannot live on our own. I and many like me live independently and manage our lives on our own terms just like NTs do. Do we need accommodation? Yes. It's a disability, but nature did not make it one. Nature did not create the fluorescent light bulbs that overload my eyesight, or the hickey stadiums that pierce my ears. Human society did. A human society dominated by NTs, whose sensory processing is simply different from mine.

I know there are some who will come at me and lecture me about how much they ""struggled"" with having autistic family members, or how my life will be better with a ""cure"" available, and other shit like that. My answer to that is simple. SPARE ME! I don't care what struggles you think you had from knowing an Autistic person. I guarantee it does not compare to the sheer dehumanization we experience from people like RFK and his supporters. I have been frequently asked if I would take a cure if it was voluntary, and my answer is that THERE WILL BE NO CURE AND ANY ONE THEY GIVE WILL NOT BE VOLUNTARY! 

They tried it with the forced sterilizations in Germany, the lobotomies and shock therapy in America, the conversion therapy camps, the insane asylums, and the drugs. I have been hearing this nonsense from antivaxxers since I was born, and it is the same Eugenicist nonsense all the time. Humans fear differences and hate them with a passion. I get asked about the autistic people that supposedly demand a cure. They demand accommodations and to be seen as people, not burdens on society! Many who seem to have internalized prejudices from society's reception to them. 

Autism is a fundamental part of our brain wiring. It is woven into our design, deciding how our brains function, how our body reacts to stimuli, how we perceive the world around us, how we talk, feel, think, and experience our own existence. For us, the fact society wants to take that away says that it does not see us as people, but as problems that are a blight on humanity. 

Every time this ableist view of Autism is propagated, it tells me that I am not human. I am somehow less deserving of my individuality than those who are not autistic. That something is inherently wrong with my own personhood. 

Imagine for a bit that part of you that makes you unique. A quirk or a difference of whatever kind. It makes you stand out, and gives you a sense of individuality, neither good nor evil. It just is. But society decides that this makes you a detriment because it deviates from an established norm, and they tell you ""We will cure you of this ailment, no matter what."" Logically, you would not take it because there's nothing fundamentally wrong with you at the end of the day. You have a challenge somewhere and a skill somewhere else. And when the ""cure"" inevitably does not work, they decide to contain it instead. So they fill you with all kinds of substances to suppress that part of you, or put you in a room against your will ""for your safety and others."" And because they see it as a problem, they will seek to ensure that this part of you does not come about in later generations. I don't think I need to describe what comes next. The speech and the apparent rising support for Eugenics against Autistic people fills me with existential dread, as it tells me I am, to put a fine point on it, an *Untermensch.*

My Autism brought me challenges and assets in equal measure. The biggest problem is not the Autism, but how society responds to it. I am discriminated against in many fields because an NT-dominant society views Autism as an inherent inferiority. The request is simple:

**Accept us for who we are!**

I will not accept any cure, and there will never be one. I am not afflicted with a disease. My Autism is neither a blessing nor a curse. It's simply a part of who I am, regardless of pros and cons.

Late 2023, my mom and I moved from North Dakota to Dallas.

We've had our ups and downs, but we had a good run up until the past few months.

I see the way our country is going downhill. I keep telling her we need to move back to North Dakota. It's not working here anymore and it's probably not going to be safe here. We've got tariffs, we've got all kinds of that shit. We're not going to be able to afford to live here very long.

She won't listen to me. She tells me to stop being a fatalist. She tells me that this is all going to backfire big time. It's all going to blow up in Trump's face.

Oh yeah? How do you know? Do you have a crystal ball?

We argue every single day about this. She says she's not going back to North Dakota because there's nothing left for us there. She's not thinking about safety. She's not thinking about finances or expenses. She keeps looking at everything through rose-colored glasses.

Well I've decided if things get any worse, I'm taking the next Greyhound back there. She just scoffed and asked where I would live and where I would work. I would figure all that out.

She and everyone else are calling me a fatalist. I say that I'm a realist. I say that she's in denial.

I wish this was the case. I have another theory: Trump is just a psychopath.

A psychopath gets up in the morning, feels a desperate need for attention and to feel powerful, then goes through his day doing anything he needs to feel that. This often involves making others upset or harming them in some way. 

In other words, my impression of Trump is that he only thinks far enough to get his next news headline, or to watch someone else suffer from his actions.

Give Trump some time. If it's one thing we know Trump is good at, it's demonizing others to the point that his followers absorb his hatred without question. Additionally, it seemed to me like many in our armed forces were on Trump's side during his first term. 

Nazi Germany wasn't what it was because all Germans are evil. The Germans were mostly fooled. Many thought they were on the side of good without having a complete picture of what was actually happening. I'm half German, with ancestry back to WW2, and my German father's exact words were ""we were all brainwashed by the Nazis"". The same thing is happening here in the US.

Military action with Canada is problematic. The border is very wide. Big cities like Chicago and New York are nearby and very attackable.

Also 95% of dudes don't like hairy legs or armpits or mustaches on women. It's not anything to do with prepubescent shit. You're just trying to shit on the guy, but going CRAZY with your assumptions and accusations. When dudes feel/see hair they usually think- that's some dude shit, that's not that feminine....

Also dudes tend to not like girls who are tall/ taller than them/ as tall as them.... i guess you think that's not okay either. But totally fine for women to want a guy who is significantly taller than them... but women's preferences are fine, and men's aren't. Got it..... lol.

And personally I agree with the PREFERENCE. I don't like long public hair- i keep my own very well maintained and buzzed short in some areas and totally shaved in other areas- I've fully shaved before (it makes everything much cleaner and easier to clean after doing anything).

I think for him to use the term ""disgusting"" when they've been in a relationship for a bit, is the issue- it was harsh- but have no issue with his desire to speak about his preferences and find no issue with the preference.

3,217,"The issue isn't that he has a preference. It's how and when he approached it. Calling something, that's perfectly normal, ""disgusting"" on your partners body, ESPECIALLY while being intimate, is just being a jerk. In a healthy relationship, this would be something you approach outside of the bedroom and much more respectfully.

The tendency to blame this on porn is because it's true. I'm the early 90s, prostitutes and members of the porn industry started fully shaving. This led to the change in pubic hair maintenance that we see now. Same thing is true today. More porn stars are keeping their pubic hair and so it's making a comeback. (Pun intended)

Now, I don't think someone preferring shaved makes them a pedophile or anything like that necessarily. Some people just don't like hair.

However, having a ""bush"" is actually healthier for womens vaginal health. It helps protect PH balance and temperature regulation, prevent friction during sex, and it actually keeps your vagina cleaner. Having the hair in place helps prevent dust, dirt, or germs from entering and causing an infection.",1,Supportive: Offers advice or suggestions to help cope.
3,218,"Because this went beyond OP’s boyfriend simply having a preference. It wasn’t a neutral statement like “I prefer shaved,” it was a value judgment. He called her natural body “disgusting.” That’s not just about taste, it’s about shaming her for being unaltered.

It’s reasonable to question why he’s so emotionally reactive to something as normal as body hair. When a preference becomes revulsion, it often suggests a deeper attachment to an ideal, one that might be influenced by porn, cultural conditioning, or associations with youth and hyper-sanitized femininity.

So the concern isn’t just what he prefers, but why he reacts so strongly to anything outside that preference & how that affects how he treats his partner.

& As women, we often learn through experiences or anecdotes to stay hyper-vigilant of men who say things like this.

First of all, I would like you to know that this Internet stranger is very, very proud of you for standing up for yourself, for being smart and for asking for help from your trusted adults. I know that in your age, on the cusp of adulthood and of ""legal"" age, you feel like you should act like a grown up and grown ups aren't kids and this ""can't be as serious as an actual child being preyed on"" but it is. 

Second, this guy likes them young and he has most likely had his eye on you ever since you were younger, in case you knew him. Grooming behaviour can take lots of forms, but it includes making the victim doubt themselves and shifting the blame from the predator to the victim, and the victim internalising blame that it's not their own to begin with. I imagine your parents already know him even in passing, since they are planning that meeting, which also means that part of his grooming process is making himself seem like an upstanding character to the family and social circle of the victim, since the predator also grooms the family.

It's not your fault. You didn't lead him on, you didn't do anything to cause someone else to act this way. He is responsible for his own actions. He is the one who was preying on you, made a move, and now he will get to learn what it's like to FAFO. If he wasn't such a creep, he wouldn't go after someone who was born when he was 23.

I had an Audible account for a while and went through a LOT of books, and while searching for a new one I came upon this sort of fusion of a memoir and fiction by a woman who was groomed by her private school (High School) teacher called ""My Dark Vanessa""  NGL, I picked it somewhat for the steamy cover, but how she relates the way her teacher so subtly manipulated her, even having her lie for him when things started to be uncovered is just amazing.  Of course, she thought she was always ""the only one"" and when she realized, in her 30's I think, when his actions were FINALLY brought to bear, that she wasn't the only one, or even the FIRST one, she had a sort of existential crisis.

I've been a 14 year old that looked at least 21... and I lied about my age all the time. Not to be mean or entrap anyone, but because it was ""exciting"" at the time to date an older guy, and I knew they wouldn't pay attention to me if they knew my real age.

If that's what OP did, and the guy though she was 21 for example, I can understand the ""guilty"" feeling. The guy is still a creep for wanting to date someone who could be his daughter, but he's not necessarily a rapist who deserves ""a ruined life"".

7,4,"Hey, OP. I’m very sorry for your loss. But this is a common stigma of abuse and that’s why it’s so hard for abuse victims to get help, and why it continues happening until people get killed. People always make excuses for abusers, or they feel empathy, or say they can’t see an abuser doing that. The abuser lives their entire life to try and keep people from finding out how abusive they really are, except for the abuse victim. It’s what victims have a hard time getting help and leaving. Aside from the shame victims feel, they don’t believe anyone truly will believe them anyway, or when they leave or get help, no one will understand how bad it is and the cycle continues. 

This was a really hard way to find this out. But you’re helping break a stigma by seeing through it and asserting what you believe to be true. And in doing so, you’re doing right by Stephanie, may she rest in peace.

7,11,"I was in an abusive relationship from I was 17 (he was 24 at the time) to 22. I also struggled with depression and suicidal tendencies in that time period and for a while after. Years later and a bunch of therapy made me realize that one of the main reasons I was depressed at the time was, obviously the physical and mental abuse, but mainly the isolation I was feeling and not having anyone that would believe me if I opened up about it. I’ve also come to realize that one of the reasons I was suicidal was because I was afraid he would kill me one day and I wanted to control that myself. Ultimately it was meeting a new friend he didn’t already know and, surprisingly, the suicidal thoughts that got me out of it. I had someone to open up to as well as realizing: “if I don’t get out now either he will kill me or I will”. 

So to read that people are defending Luke after something that was clearly aggravated murder is baffling to me! But at the same time it’s not surprising. Abusers often use a lot of energy and time to make sure everyone they know see them in a good light and see them as a good person. Everyone apart from their victim that is. Which adds to the mental abuse. I would often get taunts of: “everyone loves me and no one would ever believe a word you say, it’ll just make you look crazy.”

The only possible reason I can think of to not judge the ever-loving hell out of the guy is if he's mentally ill, in which case the blame falls to his parents/caretakers as they failed to care for their child properly. 

Three shots in ones sleep isn't a suicide paxt thing, it's an execution. Furtheremore, lying to police and tampering with the body show clear intent to cover up the crime. I can understand that in case of a failed suicide pact that the guy panicked and wasn't thinking dtraight when he tampered with the body, but in that case I can't see the panic only setting in after shooting his gf three times.

It’s an absolute shit show, especially because abusers are often charismatic and likable socially and have everyone around them fooled. They will break the victim into a shell of themselves so everyone around them thinks they are unstable all while wearing their hero mask for friends and family.  I dated one as well at the same age. Mine did attempt to kill me. I left not long after.  

No one accidentally or in good faith shoots someone three times in the head while they are asleep. No one shoots themselves three times in the head. 

Anyone that causes a person physical harm intentionally or continues to do so after  doing so is the bad guy and I’m not understanding how we as a society came to a point where this is actually questionable? There is no reason to harm someone who is not harming you? 


Anyway, to op - consider the relationships you have with those that defend him in due time but right now just focus on yourself and closest loved ones. 

Abusers fool the people around them, that is how they get their hooks in someone in the first place. The victim doesn’t go “oh hey this person is gonna treat me like shit I want in”. You did not know Luke. You knew Luke’s mask, and that’s something all of you have to reconcile with. And it fucking sucks and it’s not fair and it doesn’t make sense and you will want to make sense but you won’t really be able to. Sometimes people are just not who they seem to be. 

I had a friend who was murdered (not a dv situation though) and it just reverberates through everything.

But people change. People get new interests and new hobbies. I think he fears the possibility people might look at him differently (not worse or better- just different), and that's scary when people who are expecting one thing see you as a different person. (He is). But there's nothing to say they won't still love and accept him. I think it's mostly speculation and assumptions, and I've been the same way. But my family and friends still are decent. It's weird seeing someone you knew, become something a bit foreign to them. But if you keep seeing them, they'll realize you're the same person just with different interests. Doesn't make them toxic, just confused and wondering if it's the same person they knew. They're just thinking you are someone else, then realize ""oh we still know you, not much at all has changed about you or your personality, you're essentially the same, there's no issue- you just found different interests""....

I think it's an issue on both sides. He's ashamed, he's worried, he think they're judgmental (and they could be, but who isn't about those they really care about), and then after getting together it's all good....   dude needs to sack up and get back together with these people, and maybe even turn some of them on to his new interests.

It's hard and can be anxiety inducing, but it'll help, and if people hate- then you know who to keep at a distance. Not healthy cutting everyone off though, and not everyone will judge like you (he/she thinks they will).

She's not the problem (agreed). She made him happy and introduced him to new things- that's what relationships are about- exposing each other to your own interests and potentially getting your partner to explore and enjoy things they hadn't known about our done before.

I don't miss that, and I suggest you do the same, at least temporarily, if online racism is bothering you too much. You don't need to hear stupidity from people you don't even know.

I won't give you a lecture about 'hating your race' because it's not like you don't wanna be Indian because you don't like Indians; it's because you hate the way people treat you. Perfectly understandable IMO.

I may be wrong here, but could adopting identities based on what YOU feel help? Do you feel British? Well tell others that you are British. Who are they to contradict. You feel Indian? Tell people that you're Indian. You don't need approval to be Indian or to enjoy Indian things. You feel both? or neither? well you do YOU. 10 people will tell you 10 different things, you should decide for yourself. 

Or you can do a 180 and ignore race altogether. I admit that it's easy for me to write it as I don't have to face the issues which you're facing, but I guess cultivating an identity other than british/indian/whatever may help lessen the impact of this race issue.

So, I’m from Latvia, born and raised until I was a tween. My households native tongue is Russian; all the women in my family were born and raised in Latvia, the men came from former Soviet countries, but all Russian speaking. There is always tension between Russian speaking Latvians and Latvian speaking Latvians; basically from the very beginning of the Soviet Union, and very obviously now. 

Now ok, mom and I move to the US bc won green card, I’m 13, speak 3 languages, no accent in English (bc in this story it matters), white, blonde hair, light eyes. I’m an immigrant; all the racist shit people would say to me about immigrants, without realizing I am one is wild. I was always outspoken too, so I would say with a straight face that I am an immigrant, and they would get so fucking stressed, saying oh but you’re different. Different bc I’m white? Different bc I have European features that you find attractive, so it’s okay for you to be racist about other people? Nah. Not in my book. I hate racists. 

I work with people from different countries and cultures bc NYC, and that genuinely makes me feel like I belong. And don’t get me wrong, I care about my culture and heritage, I keep in touch with friends from Latvia, and visit when I can; but I am not really “welcomed” there. The !American! is here, they say with mischief in their tone. As if I don’t have a wonderful career and other achievements. By saying American, they mean “stupid”, which is uncalled for and old timey lmao but still. 

So yeah. What got me through a lot of cultural crisis’ was actually just home cooking. It’s so silly but okay, I go to all the ethnic markets, I get what smells good, what looks good, what is on sale, whatever; and I just cook with everything. You have your cilantro buckwheat, with garlic bok choi, with fried fish and melty cheese and tomato and dill on top? What kind of franken cultural food is this? I don’t know. But it tastes good and it feels like the yearning of home. It feels like I’m present where I am, but also feels like I’m giving my past self a hug. 

Sometimes we feel like we don’t belong, and sometimes the secret is, we don’t. And that’s okay. You are different from other peers, your situation is different, but only you can make yourself feel comfortable with who you really are, or who you want to be.

13,4,"Lifelong motorcyclist here. I rode motorcycles from the age of around 6 until I became a father at 52 and finally gave it up. People would ask me all the time if I thought it was dangerous. They would tell me stories about friends or family members being in accidents. They would tell me stories like the one you just experienced. They would tell me I was crazy to ride. 

Here’s what I can tell you. No motorcyclist wants to cause you pain by dying in front of anyone. The reasons why people ride motorcycles vary but for the most part they center around the fact that riding a motorcycle takes them to places they would not otherwise go both physically and emotionally. There’s a reason that the book ‘Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance’ is the number one selling philosophy book of all time - and it’s not because the book is about motorcycles. But it is about the fact that being a motorcyclist can open your mind to the world we move through in ways a car can never do. 

My point of all of this is to say that very few of us want to die and that includes the vast number of motorcyclists you see. But if we are to die in a motorcycle it’s a choice we made to be on a vulnerable vehicle for reasons that aren’t always easy to articulate. If that dying man could have spoken to you or the woman that hit him I’d imagine he’d want to apologize for the trauma he’s caused first and foremost. And if he could continue the conversation he’d tell you of his many wonderful thoughts and adventures he had while riding. There’s even a chance he’d say it was worth it. FWIW I know if I had been killed while riding a motorcycle the last thing i’d want is for people involved in the accident to be scarred by my decision to ride. Nobody deserves that.

Quite honestly, there will never be a straightforward cure to suicidal feelings.

You could find yourself being skilled at something and possibly turn it into a career that you could sink yourself into.

He could have told you a week after, he could of told you 2 weeks after (the average waiting time for most STDs for testing)

As for his parents, its also complex, they have acknowledged it, and most likely they have no idea how to deal with it so they dont bring up the topic about it. Especially considering they were both kids. Maybe they also think it didnt impact OP so much.

She was 10-12, she absolutely remembers it, and “I don’t remember it happening but sorry if it did” from the abuser to the abused, as an adult, is down right unacceptable. It’s avoidant of the harm she caused.

“Maybe they think it doesn’t impact OP that much” - he had a mental breakdown with his parents over it. Saying that maybe they think it’s fine is so ridiculously dismissive of the abuse- saying “kids do that” when talking about *sibling on sibling sexual abuse* as if it is *normal* is equally dismissive and disgusting. Pastors abusing children is also “normal” if you look at it from a statistical standpoint on how often it occurs.

What happened to OP is not okay. It HAS severely affected him, and the way his family responded is cold, cruel and incredibly dismissive. It is NOT how you get past trauma. No traumatic situation is black and white, that doesn’t mean ignoring it is the solution. “She was a child” and if she stabbed him as a child, she would’ve been responsible for that too. Being a child doesn’t absolve you from the responsibility of your choices.

I don’t care how indifferent or horrified she is of her actions as a child, how she handled it as an adult is unacceptable. Huge shame on you for trying to pass the whole thing off as no big deal.

Because if it's the first one, chances are you just saddled up with someone who is an inherently selfish person and maybe it didn't surface until now. You can do better than that for friends, she ain't worth it.

If it's a best friend since childhood situation, I'd re-examine any past transgressions you two have had. People don't just randomly try to steal dudes that their friends are into. If you guys have been friends for a long time, I think that you may have ignored her previous bad behavior for one reason or another.

I dunno, I feel for you, but it's better to find out now that they're shitty people, than if you'd been being strung along by this guy for six months or a year.

  
also to any zoomers and baby millennials who do the situationship thing: why? Why is this preferable being in a committed relationship?

17,14,"to answer your question about situationships my wise elder millennial (baby millennial/zillennial whatever here), a lot of us got screwed out of opportunities to date around the time the pandemic hit. 

i at least feel as though as i was healing through my wounds and becoming a better person in my early 20's, covid hit, and then me and a lot of other people got sent to the dating app gulags, where superficiality is king (god-king even). not to mention the fact that the more your year of birth gets closer to (and certainly past) 2000, the more you're constantly bombarded in a never ending fashion by toxic ass narratives about beauty and dating left right and center. and it isn't as easy to let it go as it was back when it was just tv and print media doing such things. 

so now everyone's kind of on high alert from my vantage point. at least in the heterosexual world, girls are constantly fearful dudes are gonna hurt them bad, guys are afraid that there's a taller, bigger, better guy out there for their girl, and somehow they're not enough because of it. so now what was just a monopoly mostly men had say 30-40 years ago (objectification, overcompensation, dissociation, etc) is equal opportunity in the cis straight world. which is to say, the ills of patriarchy are now inflicted every which way regardless of whether they are a man or woman. 

and lastly, economically speaking, we are so damn cooked (this is even pre our current climate, which is only making things sm worse lmao). a lot of us don't even have the time to go and make real connections in the real world, hence, returning ""of our own volition"" back to the dating app gulags, or these superficial high school-adjacent experiences because it's convenient.",0,"Neutral or irrelevant: Does not offer support, advice, empathy, or affirmation."

Tinder was by far the worst, but pretty much all of them were nightmares.

This was actually fantastic insight, by the way. 

I frequently talk to my sister (she was born in 2001) about situationship culture, and she said nearly all of her non-church friends (and even many of her church friends) seem to keep tripping and falling into situationships. She was like ""it's always weird when you want to invite someone over for dinner and you're not sure what the etiquette is -- do you invite the situationship? Do you pretend it isn't happening? I'm LITERALLY just trying to make people compliment my baking skills and now I'm navigating some sort of complex social minefield.""

I think you're definitely right about how standards are being over-influenced by, well, influencers. I feel like Instagram and TikTok are genuinely doing crazy amounts of damage to everyone (all generations, mine, yours, alpha, boomers, Xers, all of 'em). I think everyone is dopamine sick and their brains are genuinely unable to hold normal humans to normal human standards.

 I also feel like the swipe left/swipe right-ification of dating apps has kind of turned the dating scene into something akin to a meat market. I know I felt weird being forced to judge people based on a tiny little profile and make assumptions and wonder if people were swiping left or right on me.

Re: economy based woes. Yeeeeah. Same tho. I feel it in my bones. as someone who was born in '86 \[skeleton.gif\] I, too, am horizontally mobile at best, and, realistically, downwardly mobile. I work like 50-60 hour weeks and what isn't spent working is spent doing chores and errands.

rape is bad period and we need to focus more on actually dealing with the people that commit the act, instead of pitting victims against each other. no one in their right mind would congratulate a young boy on getting raped, and if they do, that is their issue and fucked up world view that THEY have to deal with. it is not the fault of little girls who had to suffer a major trauma just to ""get justice"".",0,"Neutral or irrelevant: Does not offer support, advice, empathy, or affirmation."

I snooped your profile and saw you are 17. Im now a 45 year old guy, but when I was in my late teens/early 20s, I was desperate for romance. I had a couple friends I frequently hung out with back then, and one of them was a woman about 3 years older than me. I had long hair and a beard and she told me if I wanted a girlfriend, I should cut my hair and shave because women aren't into guys with long hair and beards. I've now been married for 12 years and still have a beard and long hair. 

My point is, you could be fat, skinny, feminine, masculine, have short hair, long hair, bald, piercings, tattoos, have scars or braces, or wear glasses or even be missing a leg or arm or be confined to a wheelchair. Bottom line, no matter what it is, there are going to be people who are either into it or it won't turn them off. And of course, don't discount personality and shared interests.  

I won't get specific, but if I'm just looking at women or images of women, I have preferred body types and looks. When I was single and dating I dated women who were outside my preferences for looks. I care more about personality than looks. My wife is actually 15 years older than me, and I was 30 and she was 45 when we met. We had enough shared interests to make the age difference not matter to me.

33,23,"While I would agree that there is no particular reason to inherently value “male validation” I would also say that OPs relationship with themself doesn’t seem particularly healthy or pure.   Just as much as no one should be treated poorly for dressing “down” it’s not healthy, fair, or reasonable to treat others poorly for dressing “up”.  Likewise, it’s easy and satisfying to say “I want to be loved and accepted for exactly who I am” but that somewhat inherently assumes that others should change and grow in their ability to accept and value; we should all be expected to grow and change or no one should.

It’s easy to focus on external issues but if someone is automatically focused on how much others see and value them and assume it is mostly or even largely just about clothes (rather than behavior, confidence, etc) it seems more like there are some deep seated flaws in how they understand and see themselves and interpersonal relationships more than anything.

I don’t see anything wrong with OP wanting to feel “desired” or “good enough” (by anyone male or female), the problem as I see it is they want they both want the external validation but they want others to change their views and behavior but they don’t want to “play the part”.  I guess to me it’s the flip side of the (equally toxic) coin to men that want to be doted on and have a female partner that plays the “trad-wife” (usually a dumb and mischaracterized role to begin with) but don’t want to be responsible for consistently playing the full breadwinner “trad-husband” role in return.",0,Not supportive: Blames or criticizes the original poster.

I like sitting down at coffee shops at least once a month, and don't talk to anyone, it helps. Just being around people, you gain more instincts about other humans.

Women like to date unconventionally attractive men (I am not saying you are, I have never seen you.) Not everyone meets society's beauty standards, and that is ok. Some unconventional-looking women are looking for a mate, too.

I am a doctor and like my job. I gained a lot of weight post partum and lost it again with good food and lots of training. I was lucky enough to find a lovely husband and have two healthy and sweet kids. So people get annoyed with my “perfect” or “successful” life and they get mean. Usually they feel like I got everything handed and they did not. In part I got handed a lot. Nice parents and no financial stress growing up. But they totally pass by the work that it took. I broke up with earlier boyfriends over red flags, independent of if I loved them. I worked my way to med school and got the specialization. I lost a  pregnancy early due to health issues. I adapted my diet and did al the stupid early morning work outs. So I am blessed, nice parents, a good brain, no mental health issues, healthy husband and kids. But I don’t agree with the whole: you were handed this life. I was handed the opportunity and worked to this point. And finding my husband was luck, but the most important part was not setting before i found him. 

So what I do when I feel this “you got everything handed to you/you loose weight so easily” vibe: I tell them about all the problems with our fixer up house. The roof is leaking again, nothing is straight. I love our house, and we knew full well some things were going to cost money to fix. But some people feel better when I mess up something. So feel good about my imperfect house. I am raising perfectly loved kids there.

56,1,"Yooo so this describes me to a T (except for I also get anxiety in crowds so no live music for me).

I got a neuropsych evaluation and they said it was psychosomatic symptoms of depression. My sleep doctor was certain after 4 at home sleep tests that it was narcolepsy but without a in lab study they could only diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia. The in lab test requires being off stimulants for 2 weeks which would require taking two weeks off work. 

But let me share what I have learned and what has helped me. No two people are the same but if someone had shared some of this info with me 15 years ago, I can’t even imagine how that could have changed my life. 

I cut gluten. It helped a lot. Eating wheat I frequently could not keep my eyes open even after 15 hours of sleep. After cutting it I was still very tired all the time but I wasn’t afraid to drive. 

I am working on cutting sugar and alcohol. Or at least cutting way back. The times I’ve done so for a sustained period of time has seen improvements. 

I got a gene test and found that I actually process methylphenidate and a few other common adhd drugs less effectively than most and that was why I could take the highest possible dose and still feel very little benefit. Doesn’t help that having add means even effective stimulants calm my brain, so I can still feel tired. 

Exercise. I used to do it all the time. After the kiddo was born, it fell off. Well, guess what got worse in tandem. It is pretty remarkable how big of an immediate difference exercise can make with energy. I’m still working on actually practicing what I preach here btw. 

Creatine: moderate benefit. 
Methyl folate: blood tests showed I was not processing folate. Noticed small improvement
Vitamin D: I’m told it helps. No immediate improvements noticed but I take anyway. 
Magnesium: helps the sleep you get be better quality. 

When you are tired all the time it is easy to position being tired as inherently bad. But everyone is tired some of the time. I am tired more often than most. But I am not as tired as I used to be. 


Action items I’d recommend if you haven’t already:
1. Get sleep doctor who you meet with beyond a single test 
2. Wellbutrin is great
3. If it’s been just 3 years since it started, honestly consider getting looked at for long covid. 
4. Try diet changes. I didn’t realize what gluten was doing until I tried eating it again after a month. 
Check out the ideopathichypersomnia, narcolepsy, brain fog, and chronic fatigue sub reddits. Lots of support and shared experiences there that helped me try things I wouldn’t have otherwise. 
5. Don’t be hard on yourself. I’m still learning this one",1,Supportive: Offers advice or suggestions to help cope.

As I made the decision to keep driving, a small must have been kindergartner appeared from the front of my car to the drivers side. Closest I’ve come to running over a kid. It was scary. Imagine running over a dang kid in the school parking lot.

Taught me to pay 1000% more attention. Glad it was just a close call for you as well. The kids aren’t even supposed to be dropped off until twenty minutes before school starts.

64,3,"Both of the people I know who took their lives were in failing marriages. They both had a boy and a girl. They both left wives behind who were probably close to serving them divorce papers already. I’m certain one was served before, I’m not sure about the other.

With the first one, I think a part of us all knew it would happen. He’d seen therapists, been on meds, but he used to joke that he’d be dead at 35 and he killed himself at 35. His ex wife is remarried. Her children look just like him. I can’t imagine he would’ve been an easy partner and she also sucked a lot. I loved him and have known him since I was 3 years old. He was my oldest brother’s best friend. My brother insists that if he had left the wife and moved in with him, he could’ve helped him. I hugely dislike her but I would never blame her for his suicide. There are a million options in this world and that’s not one of them. He was always going to end up here. It was who he was.

With the second one, a lot of us didn’t see it coming. There were some circles who knew he’d held a gun to his head and made threats before, but our circle didn’t, so they weren’t entirely shocked, but for the rest of us, we never saw it coming. That phone call I think I heard a piece of my sisters heart shattered for good. I’ve never seen her brought to her knees like that. Made me see how human she is. He was my sister’s birthday buddy, they used to drink, party, bone, went back to being friends, had their own lives and children, homes, and excitement. I couldn’t even tell you how old I was when I first met him. And then one day he blew his brains out on his back patio. His wife had to search through his pockets for his phone. His face was unrecognizable. I guess the wife served papers and he was worried about the house he wouldn’t be able to afford. His dog is buried in the back yard. The love of his life leaving him. Worries. Worries. My sister has spent night after night sobbing that maybe if he’d left the wife and just believed that he could do it, he’d have realized eventually.

Man it is not that simple. Life isn’t that grey. There’s no right or wrong answer. I don’t know why people kill themselves. I’ve had some dark thoughts and come close but some part of me knows it won’t be me. So I honestly don’t know but I do know I see an awful lot of people think they could’ve prevented it and it’s just no use. Maybe they could’ve. Maybe you’re right. Or maybe they’d do exactly what my brothers friend did-leave one toxic marriage for another and then kill himself. But honestly I suspect that some people’s brains are wired in a way that just makes living hard.

 I remember her telling me it would be so much easier if he were beating her—I was so surprised to hear that but given what you said, I understand now.

A few days before she died, she reconnected with her mom who was willing to welcome her back with open arms and even told her to bring all her pets (2 dogs 2 cats)

She talked to her mom again the day before she passed, and she and I even talked for 2 hours. I validated everything she was feeling, I told her it was going to be ok, that this part sucks but she should at least take some time for herself to figure out next steps, I assured her she wasn’t selfish.

On the day of her death, the last person she spoke to was her husband. I wouldn’t be surprised if that was the moment she was going to try to tell him she was leaving him (the night before, she told me she was absolutely terrified to tell him she wasn’t coming home). I’m sure there was a long pause on her end and he probably overwhelmed her talking about all the “improvements” he was making to the house, trying to make it look nice (on her dime of course) and how he couldn’t wait for her to come home.

Her last few words to him were “I just want to be understood” and that she might not be responsive since she was going to get some rest 😔.

Pair this with some decent training, either at the gym or some bodyweight work at home, and you will put on weight.

I wouldn't put a time frame on it, it's just going to make the whole process a lot less enjoyable and way more stressful. Take each day as it comes, weigh yourself once a week at the same time of day, track your calories and see whether your weight is going up, down or staying the same. If it's staying the same or going down, then up the calories a little, and go from there.

35-45lbs is a lot of weight to put on, 45lbs on Lean muscle could take anywhere from 5-10+ years of consistent training, dieting and good overall lifestyle choices (sleep, hydration etc..). 45lbs of general weight would take less time, but that is still a substantial amount. Set smaller goals first and go from there. Maybe have a goal weight of 145lbs, then set further goals in the future.

Not for the people around the narcissist who have never been harmed by them. So, when a person falsely decides that a person is a narcissist and begins using ""techniques for dealing with them"" all they are really doing is just being emotionally abussive and manipulative of a person who may have a relatively benign personality disorder, may be neurodivergent or could just genuinely be a victim with severe PTSD who is having trouble integrating with society.

I don't have answers - it's something I still struggle with.  But something someone told me is that it's hard to find love from the outside when it's not there on the inside.
